 Removed POV 

I removed undo criticism of Secretary Boutwell and POV. Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. The following has been removed from the article.

""""Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation.  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. """"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"""" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. """"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""""Henry Adams, """"The Session,"""" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  """"He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,"""" a New England politician wrote his brother. Henry F. French to Benjamin B. French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B. French Papers, Library of Congress.

""""Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.""""Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.''""""

I could understand this if Wikipedia were advocating the term """"specific modulus"""", e.g. because it is shorter, or more technical sounding, or whatever.  However my understanding was that Wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term.  In this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.

This name has the further benefit of being self-explanatory, whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text, which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.

I therefore propose moving this article to Stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it.  This won't compromise findability in any way, but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term.    """

Notes and References
Shortcut:
WP:FNNR

Notes and References appear after See also (click on image for larger view).
Main page: Wikipedia:Citing sources#How to format and place citations
Contents: These sections present (1) citations that verify the information in the article, and (2) explanatory notes that would be awkward in the body text. Some articles divide this type of information into two or more separate sections; others combine it into a single section. There is no consensus establishing a particular structure when footnotes and the works cited in those footnotes are placed in separate sections.
Title: The most frequent choice is """"References""""; other articles use """"Notes"""", """"Footnotes"""", or """"Works cited"""" (in diminishing order of popularity). The title """"References"""" may be inappropriate if the section contains both explanatory notes and citations. Several alternate titles (""""Sources"""", """"Citations"""", """"Bibliography"""") may also be used, although each is problematic: """"Sources"""" may be confused with source code in computer related articles; """"Citations"""" may be confused with official awards or a summons to court; """"Bibliography"""" may be confused with a list of printed works by the subject of a biography. With the exception of """"Bibliography,"""" the heading should be plural even if it lists only a single item.[9]

Further reading
Shortcut:
WP:FURTHER
A guideline on further reading sections is proposed at Wikipedia:Further reading.
Contents: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of editor-recommended publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject. Editors may include brief annotations. Publications listed in Further reading are cited in the same citation style used by the rest of the article. The Further reading section should not duplicate the content of the External links section, and should normally not duplicate the content of the References section, unless the References section is too long for a reader to use as part of a general reading list. This section is not intended as a repository for general references that were used to create the article content.

075a4b83f3eba42f,"""Changes to this Page - Open discussion ==
Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to """"be bold"""" and start a """"démenagement"""" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the """"general concensus"""" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.

My goal here is not to """"control"""" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved.

The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general """"Paris"""" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for """"Paris economy"""" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for """"Paris history"""" or """"paris fashion"""". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below.

In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only """"Paris"""" into the search window - I propose to move the more """"specialty"""" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a """"specialty"""" page of its own. This would even be a positive move, as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.

The irony of the sort is that, though I contribute to Wiki, it won't be to this page in any quantity. My specialty is the history of Paris, and I cannot even think to add that knowledge here - Paris' history has a page of its own. Just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.

Here I would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. I hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement - please answer with any ideas you would have. With this post I would also like to """"sound the board"""" - to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page, as what I have seen to date leaves room for doubt. In your answers, I hope for evidence to the contrary. 

Please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all.

Hello Barto. I am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the Ron Gostick page and are you the creator of it?  As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.

However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).

I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of """"anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.

I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.  One was a recent high-level member of the Kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it.  Living or dead, I don't care to see this happen to anyone. 

Feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish.  Do you have a wiki email or a private one? """

From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh"

Ok, I just watched the whole video and nowhere in it does anyone say anything about ADD.

If there is something about ADD in there, it must in some kind of code that my old ass can't decipher, but I heard no such admission. As for using YouTube as a source, I wouldn't accept it as one. I don't know if there is a policy about YouTube not being used, but I tend to replace YouTube links anyway because they are forever removing videos and if something is true and noteworthy, there would be more than just a video source. In this case, I found nothing else to back up the ADD claim. Perhaps the person who wants to include it should give find a secondary source because the one provided doesn't back up the content.

It was not a personal attack, but rather a racist remark about Indians in general. No, I did not accuse Anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the English language because he is Indian, his nationality was irrelevant. Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community. There is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks, Asians view the world differently than Europeans and North Americans. In my opinion the sooner editors are restricted to editing Wikipedia in their native tongue the better.

Whilst Dr. Beck asked only that we take down the BDI-II, I still have to pay $4 a copy for the original BDI-I so I must assume that's under copyright and licence as well. I'm going to try and find some relevant bits from WP:C to justify (or not) removing the links. From what I can see the relevant text is here: 
Linking to copyrighted works
""""External sites can possibly violate copyright. Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Also, linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on us. If the site in question is making fair use of the material, linking is fine.""""
From what I can tell, I think that the sites that are hosting the BDI-I and BDI-II are violating copyright. Most of them don't say that they have permission to use the instrument, they don't cite the original paper, and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies. Now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with Harcourt individually, but it seems unlikely. A lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects; I don't think there is an exemption for educational use, but then university psychology departments often buy a """"portfolio"""" of test copyrights for limited use. This would not normally extend to use on the web however. In terms of next steps, I actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go, but rather we could list the issue at WP:CP?
If it's an issue of helping depressed people, I'm not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good. After all it just produces a number, it's only useful in context. One option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help . For instance, MoodGym is a site which allows users to self-administer cognitive behavioral strategies .

 Removal of images of nudes 

To editor 96.60.28.170... To be honest, you raise a good point; however, it is my opinion that any children who may see these images of classic paintings will not only be enriched by them, but also they will probably not see the """"nasty"""" side that some adults might see.  When I was a child, I saw great beauty is such works of art.  And I also saw great beauty in a Van Gogh, or a Rembrandt or any number of works by great artists.  Sculptures of David, Venus de Milo and other nude or scantily clad subjects are a part of this world.  And I might add they are some of the better parts of this world. 

Since this is an article about """"Truth"""", I would ask you to honestly state your real concerns here.  Are you worried that some child will see these nudes and they will cause him to become a pervert?  Is it your concern that children will be permanently marred by being exposed to nudity?  Children, as you may know, have very short attention spans.  They revel in one fascinating thing after another, rarely staying with one thing for any length of time.  In any case, it is a violation of Wikipedia's Neutral point of view policy, as well as the content preservation policy to remove works of art such as these for no reason other than it is one person's point of view that the nudes should not be viewed by children.  If these images are offensive to you, then by all means use your mouth quickly and click on another article.

If you are familiar with MIS (the church's membership database), you'll notice that when they reach the age of eight they are removed from membership roles if they are not baptized within their eighth year. However, if their parents are still members, their names are kept in MIS (not as members, but part of a family who has a member) with the parents until they are 18. Non-Baptized spouses are also included. If I remember the designations for these are """"Child of Record,"""" (0-8) """"Unbaptized"""" (9-18) and """"Non-Member"""" (18+).

Dear Sniperz11, Thanks for your help, advice. We shall try our best to bring Brahmo upto acceptable wiki standards. Please keep checking that page every 2 days or so and post on the Talk page there. Actually there is a distinction between Brahmo(s) and Brahmo Samaj. Brahmos refers to adherents (members) of the Brahmo Religion whereas Brahmo Samaj refers to """"followers"""" of the Brahmo Samaj (qv. Hindu Code 1955). So whereas all Brahmos are Brahmo Samajis, the reverse is not necessarily true, and which is why Brahmo and Brahmo Samaj cannot be merged and in fact will differ at certain places. However, this has nothing to do with the BrahMos missile and I foresee a disambigunation page for Brahmos sometime in the future. Cheers.  

Dear Bikash,
We have to improve the content on the page. Add infoboxes, images, and citations. Then we have to check all those spelling and grammatical things.

... and not the first, but I will have to do more research to nail this down.  

Salafis place great emphasis on ritual not only in prayer but in every activity in life - three fingers should always be used when eating, water is to be drunk in three pauses with the right hand while sitting [13], making sure their galabea or whatever garment they wear does not extend below the ankle[14]  so as to follow the example of Muhammad, the Sahaba (the first generation of Muslims), the Tabi‘in (the second generation), and the Taba‘ at-Tabi‘in (the third generation)[citation needed] and make religion part of every activity in life.

Salafism differs from the earlier contemporary Islamic revival movements of the 1970s and 1980s commonly referred to as Islamism, in that (at least many) Salafis reject not only Western ideologies such as Socialism and Capitalism, but also common Western concepts like economics, constitutions, political parties, revolution and social justice. Muslims should not engage in Western activities like politics, """"even by giving them an Islamic slant."""" [15] Instead, Muslims should stick to traditional activities, particularly Dawah.

Totoro and Shinto
I don't believe the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" is necessary. Totoro has nothing to do with anything religious. Even though there appears shrines and a tree with a shimenawa, it doesn't mean that Totoro has shintoist themes because you can see shinto shrine everywhere in Japan. Regarding appearance of shrine as Shintoism is just a misunderstanding by foreigners who have little knowledge of the Japanese way of religion. Obake has nothing to do with shinto either. No Japanese people regard obake as a part of shinto. If you call Totoro religious, almost all Japanese anime and manga will be religious. Do you call Inuyasha religious just because Kagome lives in a shrine? Or do you call Yu Yu Hakusho religious because Yusuke became a ghost and there're many yokais in the show? Or do you say Shrek has Christian themes just because there's a church? Calling something shintoism just because it is traditional is nonsense. Even if Totoro seems to have shintoist themes to the westerners' eyes, it just means Totoro is a movie set in the Japanese countryside and it is nothing worthy of special mention.  

You may believe most Japanese people are shintoist, but it is not necessarily true. They go to shrine on New Year's Day not because they believe in shinto but simply beacuse it is Japanese tradition. The same thing can be said about the appearance of the shrine in Totoro. The appearance of shinto shrine or that of obake cannot be connected to shinto. Believe it or not, it is true that there's no Japanese word for """"shintoist"""" although there is the word for """"Buddhist"""", bukkyouto. In other words, Japanese people don't regard them something like """"shintoist"""". To Japanese, shinto is not something you believe in or you don't blieve in. There's no bible or dogma. Shinto is nothing like Christianity, Islam or Buddhism. It is even doubtful whether it is proper to say that shinto is a religion. 
Totoro is nothing religious. Repeat, the appearance of the shrine doesn't mean Totoro has shintoist themes. I must say that to see Totoro religious is only a biased viewpoint. If there're no dissenting opinions, I will erase the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" on the 24 of April, a week after my first note on the issue.  

True, Totoro is not religious, but there are significant Shinto themes throughout the film. The Totoro are forest/nature spirits, the tree where they live is part of a shrine, and so on. Having Shinto themes does not mean Miyazaki was trying to get across some religious point. Rather, I imagine he was trying to evoke images of a lost past (as it is set in the 1950s) when things were simpler, and trying to get people to remember their roots and not forget their traditions. As you wrote yourself, Shinto is not so much a religion anymore (except to a very few), but more of a set of traditions with some religious elements. Totoro can have Shinto elements without being a religious film. I don't think anyone is arguing the film is religious. You're the only one who's said anything about that. I do find it odd how you reply to yourself above, and appear to be arguing with yourself.···? · Talk to Nihonjoe 

No, I didn't talk to myself. I wanted to say some more. That's all.  

Although I reverted the deletion of this section (see following thread), I have no familiarity with this topic and no opinion whether this section belongs in the article or not.  ☎ 

I agree with Michael Friedrich. All the spiritual creatures appearing in Totoro (totoro/troll, cat-bus, etc.) have as little resemblance to traditional Japanese/shinto spirits as monsters from Nausicaä in contrast to those from Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away that have more expressly Japanese looks and names. 

In either way, unless the author of the section have reliable sources to back up his interpretation of this film in there, it should be removed. A couple of sentence that cite McCarthy's article may stay, but the rest appears to be a product of original research.   

Funnily enough, the only reference to religion in Totoro that I ever heard (well, read) seriously discussed is to"

Second, that it is absurd to assert the logical invalidity of all other definitions of the word """"man"""" but that based on self-reported identity.

I agree that the example is conceptually difficult. My view is that a range of interally consistent interpretations of that situation are possible, such that the choice betweeen these arguments cannot be made on a strictly logical basis. The arguments must admit of some strictly non-deductive premises (adductive, inductive etc.) It should be clear then that I'm certainly not advocating a """"definitive, binary and absolute"""" definition of """"man"""". And my reference to Wittgenstein is based upon his fundamental recognition that any word is a """"social construct""""; indeed it is precisely because of this that Wittgenstein argues that nothing that is exclusively self-defined (such as his example of the 'beetle' in the box) can have meaning.

 To conclude, whilst there legitimate arguments for doing so, we don't have to """"wade into the mud"""" of self-identity, and basic encylopaedic principles demand that.

This is a helpful article. But there is a minor problem with this exposition:

 Second time of asking: do you know which player is being wrongly attributed by Bluemoon with the goal that James claims in his book Tommy Booth scored in the Anglo-Scottish cup game against Sheffield United? Can you also give me the page reference so that I can include it in a footnote?  I would also like a page reference for the Honved UCWC cup tie team line-up so I can include that in the footnote I've already written which you need to validate against James and let me know that you agree with it. I got a little ahead of myself in writing that particular footnote. I claim in it that James has Book playing in the game with Booth taking no part in the match. I happen to know that to be true because I saw City play every home game that season. That obviously doesn't help me with the away fixture at Honved but I definitely do remember him being out during one of his main seasons during the period I was a regular in the Kippax due to his having an operation on his knee to fix his cruciate ligament. Booth, Doyle and Oakes were almost regular fixtures in the team at that time, playing every game, so his absence from that mighty midfield triumvirate (and Heslop taking over the CH role) is something that I do still remember 45 years later, although until this issue came up to jog my memory I would not have been able to pin it down to the autumn of 1970. I'm surprised I even recall it after so long a period, but Google is your friend once you know what you are looking for, so I have now found a few articles out there that prove he could not possibly have played in that game. But that's all by-the-by; the footnote isn't about my own uncitable knowledge and fond memories. It addresses what Bluemoon states versus what James states in the book, and I have no idea what James states until you tell me. But if it is not in line with what I have already written then we have a big problem! Finally, to round things out, could you also send me a page reference for """"Der Bomber""""'s appearance in the Barnet game and I'll add that to his footnote in the same manner as I included your page reference for the Coventry City match (which I was also at) in Paul Power's footnote.

Further discussion
An unregistered editor just edited Oregon State University and asserted that it's a flagship university citing only this reference.  It's a reliable source but it's really, really weak evidence for such an important claim.  The paper was released ten years ago and classifies institutions as """"flagships"""" based on data that were already over ten years old when the paper was released which means the data are now more than twenty years old.  The document was published as an NBER working paper which means that it may have undergone some sort of review process but it was not published in a peer-reviewed journal or other venue where we are assured of editorial oversight and quality control (although I assume that the NBER has those kinds of mechanisms in place; I just don't know for sure).  This single piece of weak evidence is entirely insufficient to justify such a strong claim.    
Here's an article that references OSU as a flagship university that also passes WP:RS and is far more recent: Source.   
That doesn't explicitly call OSU a flagship though, just that according to the author of the article there are two flagships. For all we know the author could think WOU and EOU are the flagships. Personally, I think OSU shouldn't be listed as flagship  if you do a quick search for UO's flagship status, there are comparatively many many more sources backing that up. 65.78.144.35  
Actually, the The Bulletin article implies that the chancellor of the Oregon University System said that the two institutions are flagships.  But it's not a direct quote so it's not entirely clear if that is something the chancellor said or the reporter's opinion or interpretation.  Without knowing which of those two possibilities is correct, this is pretty weak source, too.
There have been several discussions and edit wars about the flagship status (or lack thereof) of several universities lately so I apologize if I'm repeating myself but I urge you to consult the sources in Flagship; they're pretty good sources and include many of the most authoritative on this very subjective, murky, and ill-defined topic.  You'll be on much better ground if you can cite sources written by experts in higher education.    """

There is a difference between Pink Floyd the band (which this page is about) and Pink Floyd the corporation. As Far as Pink Floyd the band is concerned, Roger Waters has not been a member since 1985. A member of a band is someone who plays in the band. Further, Roger Waters has no rights to any of the new music/albums that have come out since he left. i.e. Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Once again showing that he is no longer a member. Finally, Pink Floyd does not need permission from Roger Waters to release albums such as Pulse. He does get paid royalties, but that is it. Further, I fail to see how you could list """"The estate of Richard Wright"""" as a member of a band. Does the estate play the piano? No. It receives royalties for sure, but that doesn't make it a band member, it makes it a corporate member. I agree with Radiopathy that they should all be listed under former members. This is inline with the template on Wikipedia for musical artists. I would challenge anyone to find a Wikipedia page on a band that lists members who are no longer active as """"members"""" and not """"former members"""". I would also challenge you to find a band (other than the beatles, which I agree I don't like that format) that is inactive that doesn't list it's members as """"former members"""". Perhaps a good comparison would be the band Genesis. On their page only Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and and Mike Rutherford are listed, even though Peter Gabriel still own rights to aspects of the band like Roger Waters does to Pink Floyd. Also, INXS does not list Michael Hutchence as a member. Why? Because he's deceased, as it clearly states on the page. I'm sure his estate receives royalty payments. I would argue that the problem we are having is that some folks are simply unwilling to acknowledge the fact that Pink Floyd exists without Roger Waters, but I could be wrong. What's frustrating is to see that this article, which was once a featured article, deviates from the norm in more than one respect in regards to this section. 1 - it lists current members of a band that is inactive (I'd be willing to have that discussion), and 2 - even if we determine that the band is active, it lists a member who is no longer playing witht the band, and a member who is deceased.

Wikipedia:No confidence
Edicts from above are a growing concern for those who believe Wikipedia should be what it purports itself to be in newspapers, magazines, and to new members: a community of editors. As a community, we believe that members who have greater power should use that power to promote consensus and a neutral point of view. When an administrator abuses his or her greater power to promote self interest or personal POV against or without the consent of the community, we believe that member should lose his or her administrative or higher powers. Would you be interested in starting and/or promoting a Wikipedia:No confidence area for the purpose of demoting administrators and above who use their power to push personal POV?

In such an area, any editor could call for a show of support or no-confidence for an administrator or higher. People would sign for either support or no-confidence along with examples of the editor in question creating an edict without consensus, or a statement of why they believe the alleged edicts are in line with community consensus. Please feel free to start or add to Wikipedia:No confidence and to duplicate this message or tell other editors who want to see Wikipedia succeed. KIMP (spewage)"

The station's official format is Classic Rock, not Rock, Album Oriented Rock and not Active Rock. I received this response from users who will not allow me to edit the content myself:
""""I talked with that other user and he said since WACL """"makes no clear distinction in its marketing (and based on the station website and group website, it doesn't) either rely on the Arbitron listing (which is derived from the station's own reporting)"""" it should fall under the Rock label.

In my opinion, the accuracy of the content depends on fact, not on how the station markets itself, and not on Wikipedia users' opinions of what the station sounds like. The station does, in fact, rely on Arbitron when creating sales pitches to their advertisers, and Arbitron lists the station as Classic Rock because the station has reported to Arbitron that it's official format is Classic Rock. Having an extensive amount of professional experience in radio in Harrisonburg, Virginia qualifies me as an expert on this particular subject.

On March 7, 1997, the format was changed to classic rock, branded as """"Cool 98.5"""". To accommodate this, the callsign was changed to WACL. On May 2, 2001 at midnight, WACL changed their branding to """"98 Rock"""". On April 1, 2008, WACL began carrying the syndicated radio program Nights with Alice Cooper, when it moved from WBHB-FM at 105.1 FM (now WTGD) to WACL-FM at 98.5 FM when the format had been switched to classic country.

Music

WACL plays a blend of Classic Rock and Active Rock.

Definition

TABIn this proposal, I will discuss why the Wikipedia definition for “Probability,” is not a good, valid definition, and needs to be changed. Probability is something that is used every day. It is what helps us further understand the outcomes of the events in life that are uncertain. However, in order to further our knowledge of probability, we must truly understand the definition of the word first. According to Wikipedia, there is not a clear, valid definition for probability, and I propose to change this.

User:Nparibello-NJITWILL/Summer 2012 | Probability

TABThe given Wikipedia definition is as follows: Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.[1] The proposition of interest is usually of the form """"Will a specific event occur?"""" The attitude of mind is of the form """"How certain are we that the event will occur?"""" The certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number, between 0 and 1, we call probability.[2] The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur. Thus, probability in an applied sense is a measure of the confidence a person has that a (random)event will occur.

The opening sentence brings great concern as to what probability really is. It begins with, “Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.” The word ordinarily is not only ambiguous, but makes the opening sentence tell us very little about what we are reading about. Aside from the ambiguity, the rest of the sentence is extremely confusing as well. Although I am someone who has studied probability not only for my college degree, but also on my own to further my knowledge, I still had to read that sentence over and over again to understand what the writer meant. I would not consider probability an attitude of mind, because this simply does not make sense. The “proposition of interest” and “attitude of mind” are unnecessary and confusing when defining probability. Probability is the analysis of the outcome of an uncertain event. 
TABThe given Wikipedia definition gives several examples of what probability is, rather than defining it. It states that, “The proposition of interest is usually of the form…” This is not only an example instead of a definition, but it is an extremely poor example. The word usually is very vague, leading the reader to believe that the given example does not apply to probability all of the time. The definition also ends with probability in an applied sense. But what does that really mean? Because there are no other examples of another sense that probability applies to, this makes the definition unclear.
TABThe definition then goes on the describe probability in mathematical terms using the range between 0 and 1. For anyone who has not dealt with probability in a mathematical sense, this definition most likely makes little sense. The way it is written is very vague, but what it is trying to say is that there is a range of outcomes in probability starting from 0 (the event will definitely not occur), to 1 (the event will definitely occur). These ranges are also often written in percent form, 0% to 100%. I believe that by adding the fact that these numbers are percentages, the numbers already start to make a more sense and become more valid. The range between these numbers is the percent of likeliness of an outcome. While this definition gave many examples that do not help the reader to further understand probability, I would perhaps include one common example when dealing with the mathematical sense, even though definitions should not include examples. For example, the probability of a fair coin landing heads after it is tossed is .5, or 50%. This is because there are two possible outcomes, heads or tails, and both are equally likely. If the coin had been unfair with heads on both sides, the probability of landing heads would be 1, or 100%, since there are no other possible outcomes. As stated in the original definition, “The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur.”

TABTwo good quality sources comes from Richard L. Sheaffer in his book, Introduction to Probability and Its Applications, and Glenn Shaffer in his book Probability and Finance. Both Sheaffer and Shaffer are well known mathematicians whose textbooks are used in a vast majority of colleges, including NJIT. Both of their main mathematical focuses aim a probability, making them two of the best sources for this proposal. From a mathematical standpoint, Richard Sheaffer states that “Probability is a numerically valued function that assigns a number P(A) to every event A so that the following axioms hold: P(A) >= 0, and P(S) = 1.” Glenn Shaffer explains these axioms in a more wordy, les"

To be very blunt, I do not believe you. Checkuser data indicates with almost absolute certainty that all of these accounts are unquestionably being operated by the same person. So many questions arise now... I want legitimate answers to these:
How did some of the accounts you claim are completely unrelated to you find out about the WikiCup and sign up for it?
Why did you sign up for the Wikicup with accounts you claim you were only going to use as bots? 
How do your neighbors manage to have absolutely identical hardware and software (not common software either) installed on their computer that you do, and edit with the same mobile devices? The same with your pen pal. Strange...
Why are you letting your older brother access your accounts? 
Why did you lie to me and say that Reborn American was your brother, and that you now have his computer, when I can see clearly from checkuser data that that account has never accessed Wikipedia using anything other than an iPhone?
To be honest, if you had said from the beginning that they were all being operated by you, I would have warned you not to do it in the future, and probably left it at that. Now that I know that you are not securing your accounts from your own brother... Not to mention knowing that you are willing to flat-out lie to me.... Let me just leave it at, my attitude is slightly different now. gabsadds 

I'm not trying to lie (in fact I never lie when it comes to serious matters just like this) but I'm serious about every single detail. I'm afraid I'll just leave it like that. Please don't block me for what my brother did. I can't take anymore criticisms and hatred  because of what I am and what I think.    

Ps. These are my answers. 
1. I told them about this competition and they were very interested so I told them """"Go ahead. Do it.""""
2. I said Runs like a cheeta, stings like a bee and IronMöogol8.0 were going to be my bots and they weren't on the signup list.
3. My father works for a computer company and he built some for my neighbors and for my penpal in Tusla. The mobile devices, however, I'm confused about too.
4. I didn't. He would take my accounts by force.
5. I said my younger brother is Reborn American and I own my older brother's computer. Other than the time he used his account on my iPhone, her forgets that he has an account and edits on mine instead.
6. Everything is true.

=The authority of the user Node_ue in the matter of languages

Mark Williamson also known as Node_ue is a kid of 16 years old. (Born at 1989-08-18, Scottsdale, Arizona, United States [] )

What is the authority and credibility of this kid in the matter of languages? He didn't finished his highschool yet. All other words are useless …

How can a kid have the authority to state that the languages of two states are not identical since by all the linguists of the most important universities and other internationally institutions recognize this fact? See the links mentioned above by other users.

Who is Node? Who is Mark Williamson? Just look at the picture:

Poor little Node having problem with """"moldovan"""" language! Sic!

I think Mark Williamson known also as """"Node ue"""" is having difficulties to reject """"romanian"""" words out of his mouth!

Nevertheless the authority of Node_ue is very good presented by himself in [] 

Just take a look the way the Kid Mark looks himself: (Warning! May be in various ways interpreted!) 

Mark is an all-powerful entity made of pure energy. If you know him, you will be blessed and your dreams will come true (or at least they might).

Strengths: All powerful, handsome, smart.

Weaknesses: NONE!!! THE GREAT MARK HAS NO WEAKNESSES! HE IS ALL-POWERFUL!

Special Skills: All-powerfulness, intelligence, &c.;

Weapons: All-powerfulness... sharp teeth... hrm...

All-powerfulness: YES! THE GREAT ENTITY KNOWN AS """"MARK"""" IS ALL-POWERFUL!!! YES!

Of course his ass is so painful….Guess why?!

Node's origin as a faggot and Jew…
[] (where he admits he is a faggot and 3/8ths parts Jewish origin)

""""I've also noticed a few things that are possible hints at his thinking he's homosexual/bisexual but not wanting to admit it to himself:
He lies quite a bit to make himself look more """"masculine"""" (apparently he's the most popular guy in school with the girls, and he has to run quickly if he wants to get away from them), he is always going on about how much more attractive he is than me (according to him, this is because both of his parents are of 100% Jewish ancestry, while I only have 3/8ths [3/4ths of the people on my mother's side]), he goes out of his way to make extremely offensive jokes about homo/bisexuality, he goes out of his way to make it look like he's a homophobe, and at the mention of anything even remotely related to homosexuality he has so much disgust for it that he must show that you could fill a whole encyclopedia with his """"ewws"""" (not really meant seriously, according to him).""""

 needs balanced perspective 

Climate change should be discussed with global warming entry – they are one and the same thing.

This has to be a balanced discussion also discussing the forecasts and uncertainties in forecasting temperature / CO2 increase which are proposed as the causes of the examples of climate change that are presented.

Discuss the politicization (sp?) of the entire issue, the role of IPCC, of Gore etc.  This is very much at the heart of the attention and emphasis being given.  

Discussion of post 1950s warming does not mention the pre 1950s temperature drop that is not explained by the forcings and “predictive” climate models. 

The forecasts / predictions are major part of the actual basis for the attention and emphasis in the carefully planned publicity campaign of the IPCC.  IPCC readily acknowledges that their role is to expand awareness to provide push for policy makers.  The 90 / 95 / etc. probabilities are without merit, are not based on independent scientific fact but Delphi polling of scientists who are doing the scientific modeling.  In fact, IPCC acknowledge that it is not possible to predict the future trajectory which is why they are developing scenarios not forecasts.  Scenarios assume a set of initial values or base starting points for the forcings and forecast how these forcings will play out over time.  This does not adequately take into account technological change that is and will continue to occur.  None of this is identified and discussed in this entry.

In this regard, some analogies with Thomas Malthus """"An Essay on the Principle of Population"""" (1798), [aka """"Malthusian catastrophe, Malthusian crisis, Malthusian dilemma, Malthusian disaster, Malthusian trap, or Malthusian limit (Wikipedia)], Paul Ehrlich """"The Population Bomb"""" (1968), Club of Rome """"Limits to Growth"""" (1972), as well as Orsen Well radio case of H.G. Wells """"War of the Worlds"""" (1936) as an example of how the media can be an  effective force in public opinion.

Both in the US and UK court rulings do not allow presenting / discussing the climate change issues without a balanced view of the issues such as mentioned here.  Wikipedia entries should also be required to be required to meet the same standards in presenting balanced views. 

The need for climate change policy is  based on economic evaluation of the future pattern of costs vs. benefit.  The Stern review – which is discussed – has been strongly criticized in peer reviewed journals because of its assumptions and approaches which very greatly favor support the recommendations, which is neither scientific or intellectually honest.  See e.g., the following references.

Nordhaus, WILLIAM  Q., “A Review of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change,” Journal of Economic Literature Vol. XLV (September 2007), pp. 686–702

economic-environmental models: Purchasing power parity or market exchange rates?,”  Science Direct: Energy Economics 29 (2007) 349–372  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

You seem to have missed the line at the very beginning: 'for current global climate change see global warming'. Merging them would be like merging the history of the United States with the 2008 presidential election...  

The global warming page in the terminology section states that global warming is an example of climate change, a subset as it were. The way these two articles are broken up is completely wrong. 122.104.2.224  

How so? Global climate change is purely the projected change of the climate. Global warming is an example of climate change - it is the heating of the climate. However, if temperatures drop, which many people believed before, that too would be global climate change. 
I do, however, agree that this page needs to be expanded.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • [[Special:Co"

 Understanding how Wikipedia does things 

Hello Mike, I see you have some concerns about the article. First off, I want to note that this is exactly why we always tell people don't try to write your own article on Wikipedia. I was willing to write one for you because I think you're an interesting subject, but you really need to stop trying to work on your own article. It is absolutely impossible for you to be objective about your own work, and also you keep trying to make edits which are not properly sourced. To answer a few points:

Why are the links to the National Traditional Country Music Association pages and the Library of Congress Recorded Sound Reference Center underlined in red as non-existent? These sites do exist.  They are non-existed on Wikipedia; we aren't saying they're non-existent in general, just that nobody has written an article about them here yet. The red means """"someone should write an article about them"""". Before they were blue because you were re-routing the link to go to their own homepage, but we don't allow such external links to be used in the middle of the page like that, and also because that obscures the fact that we need somebody to write those articles.
 Regarding your nickname: if you say Plantenga is wrong, I've removed the nickname. However, you cannot simply go and fill in whatever nickname you want in its place, unless you have a clearly cited source.
 You really need to read our guideline/warning WP:Autobiography to understand exactly why you shouldn't be messing with your biography. You should not be making any edits on that page except to remove blatant vandalism. Again, you are literally the last person on earth who should be editing your own biography on Wikipedia, because doing so compromises the neutrality of the project.
 Lastly, I really suggest you read WP:Verifiability, not truth. The long/short is that a given fact is only useful if it can be cited to a good source, and no matter how true a fact is, it's no good on an encyclopedia without citation. So while we of course recognize that in the larger world, accuracy is the goal, on an encyclopedia our concern is how documentable a fact is. So on a certain level, we literally don't care whether a fact in Plantenga's book or in a Washington Post article is completely accurate, we care that it's clearly documented. Whereas if you make """"corrections"""" based on your personal knowledge, that just makes the article weaker because each such edit decreases its Verifiability.

At this point, you really need to just accept that you have a biography on Wikipedia, and it's sourced to published works, and be (moderately) happy with that. Wikipedia is absolutely not here for you to """"get the rest of the story out"""", or """"build your brand"""" or whatnot, we're just here to compile and organize information that has already been published by neutral experts. So please refrain from trying to edit your own article, it always ends badly and wastes time for everyone involved to have to change things back and forth, and just trust the Wikipedia community to do our best to keep things running smoothly.

 Yep.  This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism.  (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.)  There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives.  The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism.  In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.
 As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.  If we told it that """"CITATION NEEDED"""" was not vandalism, then the next time they used """"NEED CITATION"""", or """"CITATION REQUIRED"""" or """"FACT CHECK"""", then the bot would not catch it.  We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake.  The radio station edit is even more tricky.  And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations?  We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not.  And I for one have no idea what we could use.  New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference.  The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more.  It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. -  """

 Jim1138 

Hi.

How did you get involved in this business with ?

Jim1138 left an erroneous and damaging Edit Warring warning on my page.

You can see what he did here. In the 'History' section, he replaced an entirely duplicated section, duplicating the content immediately above it. He called it an """"Unexplained removal of content"""". No content had been removed, it had only been paragraphed ... which he then duplication. 

He was obviously in the wrong. He obviously paid no attention to the content. 

Then he left the erroneous and damaging bad mark which I have asked him politely to apologise, and remove and erase it.

It strikes me it would take a lot less effort just to do so than all this running around.

The Objectivity of this Discussion is doubtful (non-existent)

(1) As indicated earlier, the section on Marxist leaders’ views is misleading:

(a) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on Trotsky, creating the misleading impression that other prominent Marxists (Marx, Engels, Lenin) did not advocate and/or practiced terrorism;

(b) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on the theoretical “rejection of individual terrorism”, creating the misleading impression that this is the main (only) Marxist position on terrorism. 

(2) The discussion is not being properly monitored:

(a) no discernible attempt is being made to establish and maintain an acceptable degree of objectivity;

(b) important and relevant scholarly works such as the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism are being ignored or illicitly excluded from the discussion;

(c) though the only logical way to remedy the blatant imbalance in the above section is to include quotes by/on other leaders who are known to have endorsed and practiced terrorism all attempts to do so have been systematically blocked with impunity by the apologists for Marxist terrorism who have done their best to sabotage and wreck both the article and the discussion.

(3) Among the tactics deployed by the apologist wreckers and saboteurs the following may be identified as representative examples:

(a) it is claimed that Marx and Engels did not advocate terrorism despite the fact that scholarly works like the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism show that they did, and Marx himself was known as “The Red Terror Doctor”;

(b) it is claimed that Marx and Engels were not involved in terrorist activities despite the fact that numerous sources from The Neue Rheinische Zeitung to Isaiah Berlin and Francis Wheen state otherwise;

(c) it is claimed that Lenin does not refer to terror in The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky and other works/statements despite the fact that Robert Service, IET, and other scholarly and reliable sources state that he does;

(d) it is claimed that the Russian word ‘’strakh’’ does not mean “terror” when:

i. the Oxford Russian Dictionary says that it does;

ii. it is evident from the context that this is the case;

iii. any educated Russian speaker can confirm that strakh may mean “terror” depending on the context;

(e) it is claimed that Marxism is “scientific” when in fact:

i. Marx was not a scientist;

ii. Marx’s background was philosophy and law, not science;

iii. Marxism is not recognized as a science by the academic world;

iv. virtually every one of Marx’s predictions turned out to be wrong, as became increasingly apparent during his lifetime and incontrovertibly so after his death (R. Pipes, Communism: A Brief History, 2001, p. 15) from which it follows that Marxism does not qualify as a scientific system by any accepted standards;

v. the evidence indicates that Marxism is closer to a religious sect than to science proper;

(f) apologist literature is being quoted in a fraudulent attempt to whitewash Marxist terrorism, in effect turning the discussion into an advertisement for terrorism;

(g) it is claimed that Marxist terrorism is not rooted in the Marxist theory of class struggle even though there are numerous sources showing that it is (please note that it is immaterial whether terrorism had already been justified in terms of a theory of class prior to Marx, the point being that it was advocated/practiced on the basis of Marxist class-struggle theories BY MARXISTS):

“Karl Marx felt that terror was a necessary part of a revolutionary strategy” (Peter Galvert, “Theories of Terror in Urban Insurrections”, IET, p. 138);

“Revolutionary terrorism has its roots in a political ideology, from the Marxist-Leninist thinking of the Left, to the fascists found on the Right” (Noemi Gal-Or, """"Revolutionary Terrorism"""", IET, p. 203);

“… perhaps the most important key to Stalin’s motivation lies in the realm of ideology. The leitmotif of Soviet communist ideology in the 1920s and 1930s was class struggle – the inbuilt antagonism between mutually incompatible economic interest groups” (Geoffrey Robert, Stalins Wars, 2006, pp. 17-18);

this fact is supported not only by reliable academic sources, but by elementary logic: 

“In 1907 Mehring published in the magazine ‘’Neue Zeit (Vol. XXV 2, p. 164) extracts from a letter by Marx to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852. In this letter, among other things, is the following noteworthy observation: … class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat …”"

Not adhering to Wiki policy, constantly breaching anti-reversion rules and generally trolling to try and start editing wars with new editors. His latest revert - after admin decision - is clearly spiteful vandalism.
1) he left the article in an unreferenced state for months, and made no attempt to clear them up or remove them.
2) he took exception to an entry that was referenced properly, including a reference to the BBC - the BBC being a reference source for other items on this page, yet hypocrisy reared its head and TheOldJacobite failed to acknowledge, only finally accepting when having the nonsense of his illogical inconsistent application of policy pointed out.
2a) he also claimed that the newspaper source included wants notable enough despite having a readership level that warranted its own actual entry in Wikipedia - a newspaper that has been published for over 100 years.
3) he continually reverts the repair of the included entry, which meets ALL Wiki policies. These are reverted accordingly by me as they breach no rules but simply have some personal issue with TheOldJacobite. Maybe TheOldJacobite thinks he owns the page. Who knows what motive lies behind the behaviour?
4) He then summons up 'help' from a sock-buddy who also removes it and then threatens me with blocking because he can't gets his own way. That editor has no and rights so simply reverts to threats and bravado against a new user. it should be noted that Sjo has been previously warned on his page about treating new editors with contempt and warning him to stop simply removing new edits, so a behaviour pattern that is common to both of them.
5) TheOldJacobite then has me referred to admin for alleged vandalism - no action is taken. TheOldJacobite also tries to make me out as some sort of vandal purely because I have an IP rather than a full username...this is just childish diversion tactics,
6) TheOldJacobite requests the page is locked - no action is taken as admins clearly don't agree. If anything it should be locked against him reverting a totally acceptable entry.
7) Electric Wombat (admin) reviews the entry and determines it's good for inclusion and asks all to stop the edit war. I agree but would like to see an equal admonishment made to TheOldJacobite and Sjo for their arbitrary editing, non equitable application of policy and the gang-up bullying mentality against a new user.

8) Despite Electric Wombat's decision of inclusion, TheOldJacobite again reverts the entry.  this is clearly against strict Wiki rules about reverting after an admin decision has been made. I wonder if ThOldJacobite will be blocked temporarily for sticking two fingers up at the admin team?
9) I have now applied the admin decision and reverted it back to what it was before TheOldJacobite vandalised it yet again.

The amazing thing about this show was how Melvin Lindsey was at the time. I grew up listening to it and I had no idea that Lindsey was in his early 20s when he started it.  That show was so powerful and so professional that I alway thought that Lindsey was much older. It is by far one of the most moving, rich and beautiful radio shows that I ever listened to. I am saddened also to read about Lindsey's early death. What an enormous loss.

Hi Heah, 

Thanks for your reply.  First, I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions.  He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting.  I didn't know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward.  I still maintain, however, that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism.  They weren't corroborative edits, that's for sure.  They were, as I said, wholesale, repeated deletions of original text.  You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but, in this case, I can assure you that's not the problem.  Jossi's full aware of the fact that both Geaves' comments and Rawat's own contradictory words (in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival) are proven and accurate.  Here's a link to the Geaves' article:

Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves' relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype.

And here's a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves' revisionism:

The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions.  However, it doesn't say that persistent efforts in this regard may nonetheless violate the three-reversion rule and trigger blocking!  It does seem a little Kafak-esque, don't you think?

Finally, on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco, I do invite you to take some time, if you would, and review his editing of the Rawat articles.  He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader, a man who still has many, many followers who believe that he is God in human form.  Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man.  The fact that he's a Wikipedia administrator is worrying, in my opinion.  18:13"

Just noticed your question on my talkpage — somehow I'd missed it.  My understanding of the WP convention is that if a player is rostered with a club for any significant period of time, that club is listed in his infobox even if the player makes no appearances for the club.  If a player only passes through briefly and makes no appearances for the club, however, it isn't listed.  As for the other question, I'd say it's fairly common in the US for a player to spend a very brief period on the roster of one club before being traded to another: for instance, in the 2006 expansion draft, expansion franchise Toronto FC snapped up a couple of guys simply for their """"trade value"""" and then proceeded to deal them to other teams in exchange for players they actually wanted.  I believe that in circumstances like this, we wouldn't list a Toronto FC tenure in a player's infobox.  Overall, my understanding of the guidelines here is pretty shakey, to be honest.

If f(x) is a 4th degree polynomial and p,q,r,s are root approximations, the approximated polynomial is (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(x-s) and its derivative at p is (p-q)(p-r)(p-s) so a Durand-Kerner iteration for p would be p = p - f(x)/((p-q)(p-r)(p-s)) and iterations of identical form for q, r, and s follow immediately.

Saedon,

As you know, or at least should know, peer-review has become a very politicized process, not just for I.D., but for all non-mainstream scientific views. Casey Luskin has an excellent articleoutstanding article, heavily burrowed from a paper by physicist Frank Tipler, which details this, including direct quotes from multiple Nobel Prize winners on the deep flaws of the peer-review process. Even if the journal's referees, themselves, would be willing to publish pro-I.D. research, the fear of backlash  even boycotts  directed towards both themselves and their journals, surely prevents them from doing so.

You must understand, when dealing with intelligent design, we're dealing with something that causes nothing less than embarrassing, childish, outrageous, emotional outbursts from its detractors, including many scientists (the Bloggingheads incident comes to mind, where many scientists attempted to boycott Bloggingheads simply because they allowed Michael Behe on to discuss his views). These detractors, of course, include many Wikipedia contributors. I strongly suspect that includes you, which is I why you make such a suspect editor regarding this subject, and why none of my words, as reasonable as they may be, will have any effect on dogmatic thinking.

With all of this said, the Discovery Institute keeps a page archiving the many pro-I.D. articles which have been able to penetrate the politicized wall of orthodoxy that has sullied the peer-review process. The number is currently over 50, and continually growing.

Of course, once the objection that I.D. has no peer-reviewed publications in support of it has been met, the goalposts will be moved to the claim that, (a) they're not good enough, (b) there's not enough, or (c) a combination of a and b. Casey Luskin, again, has fantastic article, entitled """"Answering Objections about Discovery Institute's Peer-Review Page,"""" that addresses some of these goalpost shifts (this is the part where you ignore the arguments and attack Casey Luskin the person).

Let me also add that every paper which further unveils a level of sophistication in the cell, more design principles, function for something once thought to be junk, etc., weighs support to the notion that life was designed, and that the Darwinian view is based on ignorance.

 AMA Request 

Hi, thanks for contacting me. My problem is with User:Tigermichal over the article Deja Vu (Beyoncé song).

Basically, I haven't added anything to the page, I was just watching it. There was some paragraphs on the page about how Beyonce's fans had a petition for a reshoot for the video, and one about the song """"underperforing"""" at radio compared to her last singles, and Tigermichal kept removing them, while I kept putting them back because it's Point of View to not have them, and I think it's encyclopedic to keep them. The petition was mentioned on the TV show Extra, and the other one (which has been readded now) is just explaining the charts. So after I did a few reverts and told Tigermichal of the problem, he went after me, so I went for help.

It's not that big of a deal, and I've just ignored that page now anyways, I just think this user is a bit problematic, especially if you look at his talk page... 

Thanks,

""""Hindutva"""" as defined by Savarkar baguely means Indian nationalism that draws its 'inspiration' from Hindu/Maratha culture. It cant be called Hindu extremism is broadest sense, largely since Hindu fundamentalism is an oxymoron moreover, founding fathers of Hindutva were Agnostic Hindus. Hindutva rose as a complementary movement to Marathi cultural resurgence (all founders were Marathis (specifically Marathas and Konkanastha Brahmins and till 1970's most memebers of RSS were Marathis). Hindutva in these days is a vague ideology. It differs from one propounded by Savarkar to the one practised by 'parties' like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal.

So, the British sided with the Americans, and the current border reflects the American claim?
What were the differences between this and the Canadian claim? - Unsigned User:Geo Swan

Actually, the current boundary does not reflect the maximal U.S. claim.  I'll try to trype in some more info.   

The British didn't exactly side with the Americans; the border settlement was an arbitration (the Kaiser again, IIRC, as it had been with his father at the end of the San Juans Dispute).  The British backed down because of threats by T.E. Roosevelt that he would invade and annex British Columbia if he didn't get his way.  The main difference between the British hard position and the way things are now is that under the British terms, thet """"Yukon Ports"""" - Skagway and Haines and Dyea etc would have been """"British"""", i.e. part of British Columbia.

Canada didn't have a say in it, other than consulting London; British North American (Canadian) foreign affairs were still in London's bailiwick at that time (until 1931 or 1927 or something).

As it is under the treaty, the site of Forts Stikine and Taku should be within British Columbia; and in fact the mouths of the Stikine and Taku should be, but they've silted in a few miles downstream since the treaty was signed; the border hasn't been revised to reflect that (obviously not, even though it's in the language; same thing with the mis-survey of the 49th Parallel that's not going to get corrected, either).

There are two sticking points remaining in the Alaska Boundary Settlement.  One is that the treaty stipulates that the western shoreline of the Portland Canal is the boundary; US maps continue to show mid-channel.  Similarly with the A-B Line, which is between Point A and Point B on the north side of the Dixon Entrance; US maps show the boundary as being mid-Dixon Entrance, and the US/Alaska have even issued oil/drilling-exploration permits on """"their"""" side of that line.

Same kind of fudge-up with the Oregon Treaty; during the Salmon War of the mid-1990s Canadian commercial vessels (whale watching boats) were busted by US Coast Guard in the area of the San Juans; but the treaty is very clear that ALL commercial vessels south of the 49th Parallel are to be unhindered; that would even include in Rosario Strait, far from the current border in the Haro Strait; during the same kafuffle Sen. Slade Gorton (State-Sen) in Washington invoked the treaty to demand free passage through the Johnstone Strait for American fishing vessels (nothing of the kind is guaranteed in the Oregon Treaty, or for that matter in the Alaska treaty either) and called on the US Navy to enforce the """"international waterway"""" (which is all of a mile wide in spots).  Thing is it was the US who passed legislation that attacked non-American ships using this route, i.e. the act that makes it so that preference is given to vessels sailing from American port to American port over those from a """"foreign port"""" to an American port; this act was passed specifically to route the Yukon shipping trade through Seattle over Vancouver, even though it was Canadian/British waters that the route traversed. 

Further Thoughts

Just considering the opening statements; the treaty was actually between the British Empire, with the Dominion of Canada as a signatory party, IIRC; BC was not involved in the actual signing.

And just as aside the phrasing of the second condition of the treaty cited:

Whenever the summit of the mountains shall be at a distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit shall be formed by a line parallel to the winding of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom.

...is completely bizarre for anybody who's ever actually looked at a map of the coastline.  The negotiators were in London and Washington and Ottawa, far away with only the dimmest idea of where they were talking about.  Much the same as the Oregon Treaty, only worse; there """"the deepest channel"""" seemed at least a bit logical, even though they didn't note the issues on the map with Point Roberts and the Gulf Islands/San Juans which make that border a bit of an absurdity; which so is the 49th Parallel from the Rockies west....that aside, the Alaska treaty issue cited is utterly bizarre; the Alaskan coast is a ragged array of inlets and bays, pierced by several large rivers.  There is no """"crest of the mountains"""", for one thing - other than crowsflight-drawn lines from high peak to high peak, which i"

 Encore a mistake in interpretation  

Mr Shyamal, 

You made a serious mistake in interpretation, which seems normal for those who are not specialists in entomology and taxonomy in the dipterous ones.  But, please show me once again that I make an attack with the person of Rognes, because I must explain you where you did not understand.  

In your correct information for the articles of your Wikipedia, you must read and analyze all the bibliographical data and to understand well the problems of a taxon or a group of let us taxa.  Thus, you can note that Rognes is the only amateur faunist (and not a recognized specialist), who wishes to make """" revolutions """" in taxonomy, without knowing Bengaliidae, without knowing the morphology of dipterous (in general), without being able to make a correct identification according to the male genitalia even of usual Calliphoridae.  In more he wanted to introduce an aberrant and specific terminology for his pupils of the school of handicappers of Stavanger (Norway) where he works, and was unaware of always the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.  All its """" research """" is not recognized by the community of the specialists.  Only his friends of the same structure, namely:  Thomas Pape (the recognized intellectual robber and the most stupid taxonomist nowadays), C Thompson, N.L. Evenhuis, J.E. O' Hara and (unfortunately) A. C. Pont wrote a bibliographical work, nonscientific, in which they mentioned exactly what I have says to you before on Rognes.  He cannot identify any species of Bengaliidae and he does not have competence to establish that Bengalia testacea  is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  This false type was mentioned before by Sabrosky in a stupid work of bibliography (nonscientific), in collaboration with the same ignoramuses collaborators (1999:62).  You must know exactly that of Zumpt until Lehrer, the species-type of the Bengalia kind is Bengalia labiata R.D. - not B testacea sensu Duponchel 1842 & Rognes, which is a nomen nudum. 

Thus, for the exactitude of your encyclopaedic information you must change distort them given.  Moreover, I give you the council of reading certain articles documented by Lehrer in Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2010, 23: 1-`22 and 22-25;  24:16-20 and 20-23;  26:  21-30 [ [ http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Z._Lehrer ] ] and the work: LEHRER& WEI, 2010, Un nouveau genre oriental de la famille Bengaliidae (Diptera), Bull.

Status and Advice 
I deleted it, both as copyvio and because it would be considered promotional in any case.  

A Wikipedia article  needs to be written like an encyclopedia article, not a press releasedon't praise the organization or person, say what they do. Don't talk about the overall importance of the subjector use adjectives of praise. . Remember not to  copy from a web site, even your own  first it's a copyright violation, but, even if you own the copyright and are willing to give us permission according to WP:DCM, the tone will not be encyclopedic and the material will not be suitableas this was not.

You will need to rewrite the articles to Wikipedia  style; a good place to start learning it  is    our guide to writing Wikipedia articles .  

First, give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date, degrees, previous positions. If there are published books, list them in formal bibliographic style.  List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly, getting citation figures from Scopus or Web of Science or Google Scholar, or some other appropriate source. Do not include conference presentations, book chapters, and other minor published work. Such a list needs to be frequently updated, and belongs in the CV, not an encyclopedia.  

Include major national level offices and awards, but not minor ones and certainly not student awards. Be sure to list editorships (but not mere editorial board membership) we consider it very important, and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also, with a link to the bio. AQ award is worth mentioning; a nomination for an award is not. 
 
It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV. However, give  references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases. For any part you quote directly from a published bio, include quotation marks and a reference. Do just just say """" It has been widely covered by press outlets such as The New York Times and Forbes."""" Give the reference in full, including the title of the article and a link to it.  

Pay particular attention to the way we make links to other Wikipedia  articles.  Avoid WP:Peacock terms: do not use words of praise, ofr state that the person is important: the contents of the article will show it. 

Don't just give a general list of all the fields he is interested in. Say briefly what his research has shown, with citations. 

Include only material that would be of interest to a general reader coming across the mention of the subject and wanting the sort of information that would be found in an encyclopedia. Do not include material that would be of interest only to those associated with the subject, or to prospective studentsthat sort of content is considered promotional. Keep in mind that the goal of an encyclopedia  is to say things in a concise manner, which is not the style of  press releases or  web sites, or CVs,  which are usually more expansive.

One argument for this theory is that a simultaneous phenomenon is happening on the planet Mars, Mars Hints at Solar, not Human, Cause for Warming, Scientists Say, by Kate Ravilious, 2/28/07, National Geographic via nationalgeographic.com.  which suggests that Global Warming may not be limited to the only planet where human interaction could have influence.

d607bb6627c91c54,"Lorenzo Mascheroni (May 13, 1750 - July 14, 1800) was an Italian mathematician, born near Bergamo, Italy.

At first mainly interested in the humanities (poetry and Greek language), he eventually became professor of mathematics at Pavia.

In his Geometria del Compasso (Pavia, 1797), he proved that any geometrical construction which can be done with ruler and compasses, can also be done with compasses alone. However, the priority for this result (now known as the Mohr-Mascheroni theorem) belongs to the Dane Georg Mohr, who published a proof already in 1672.

In his Adnotationes ad calculum integrale Euleri (1790) he published a calculation of what is now known as the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

He died in Paris."

dacf846dbe8db82e,"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown.

Here are some examples of what true hazel eyes are;

Here are some sources backing up my statement;

http://www.wonderquest.com/eye-color-age.htm (states hazel eyes are light brown or yellowish brown) 

http://www.fanteye.com/extimages/p_FreshlooksColorblendsChartLG.jpg (shows a pure hazel eye, big difference to the green eye diagonally below to the right) 

http://www.colormecontacts.com/colored-contacts-for-dark-eyes (puts hazel eyes in the same category as honey, not green plus displays a green eye with abit of brown (central heterochromia) under the green category)

Hazel Eye Picture On The Right

The picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes, as it is blue with central heterochromia (brown around the pupil). The hazel eye description says nothing about hazel eyes being blue in any way, so i trust this is a mistake that needs to be changed immediately, i propose one of the following pictures be shown in it's place as they match a golden light brown hazelnut colour:

 rework begun 

I suggest to rework the """"Initial theories"""" section along these line:

First
First I suggest to delete the Technical failure section and move the relevant information (that the plane was fine) to the Investigation section under a new title and with the following text:

 The Plane 

The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154M, construction number 90A837, was manufactured at Kuibyshev aviation plant (No. 18) on 29 June 1990 for the Polish Air Force.
It was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as official government jets; this aircraft—with a tail number of 101—was for presidential use, while another—marked 102—is used by the prime minister. The aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009 and Aleksey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems. The airplane had received a 5-year/7500-flight-hour warranty after the overhaul yet the crash happened after just 138 flight hours.

Second
As second part of the rework I suggest to edit half of the VIP passenger syndrome section away and put the remaining paragraph last in the section Investigation:

There has been some speculation in the press, that the planes pilot was under pressure to land in Smolensk in spite of the averse weather conditions. These speculations were linked to an earlier event in August 2008, when another pilot of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment was pressured by president Kaczyński to land in Tbilisi during the South Ossetian war between Georgia and Russia. During that incident, Pietruczuk was asked by the president's staff to change the flight plan and land in Tbilisi. After consulting with the commander of his unit, Pietruczuk refused, justifying his decision by safety concerns. He was then visited in the cockpit by Kaczyński himself, who tried to convince him to change his mind. Kaczyński later told journalists: """"If someone decides to become an officer, they should not be cowardly"""". Nevertheless, Pietruczuk held his ground and the plane landed in Azerbaijan as planned. A few weeks after this incident Pietruczuk was decorated by the defense minister for following correct procedures in this case and keeping the safety of his passengers utmost in his mind. Pietruczuk continued to fly the president's plane after the incident, even after Kaczyński expressed unhappiness with his performance during the flight to Tbilisi.

Third
Thridly I would shorten the Instrument landing system incompatibility section, rename it and definitely delete the """"may be using"""" part and put the resulting section directly under the the section """"The"

Königsberg a) always was ethnically German, and b) never was de jure part of Poland, i.e. Poland proper. Although the (German) dukes of Prussia were obliged to render homage to the Polish monach for 150 years or so, this was a result of the defeat of the Teutonic Order and its aftermath, not a symptom of Königsberg's ethnicity, which remained German until 1945-46, when Königsberg as such ceased to exist.

Why the Prophet Jeremiah should not be censored out of this article 

All the abusive invective in the world doesn't alter the fact that when we consider the Jewish law, the following is relevant:
  
'How can you say, """"We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.'      
Jeremiah 8:8, New Revised Standard Version 

It is relevant because:

 Jeremiah is a major Jewish prophet, so his opinion carries weight.
 Jeremiah lived over 2000 years closer to the time when the books of Moses were compiled.

The fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point Jeremiah makes is sensitive. Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.

If other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this. However, censorship is not the way to make this point."""

In the serie shown as she is an amazing woman and how she began her extraordinary career, her struggle against racism and his triumph by winning as a woman in a musical world where only men was excelled, in the series is also shows how she begins conquering the world with his unique style and powerful voice, reasons that becomes her the legitimate icon of Latinos Worldwide.

f5f404e4a2614ae4,"""== Re: Telstra Article ==

Hello. I am new to Wiki but thought I had read the T&Cs; fairly well. I am surprised at the number of citations you are demanding for my edit to the Telstra mobile page. Many of the facts you are seeing citations for are indesputible engineering realities and hence you wont find a seperate statement from someone claiming same (although you may find news paper articles backing some of the claims). The points made about 850 having superior coverage to 2100 cant be disputed and I would ask since that being the case, what sort of citation should I be looking for to back up the statement?

I accept referencing Whirlpool for carrier customer numbers is a bit slack. The only reason I did that was that in that discussion thread was a neatly pulled together list of each carriers end of year reports showing their customer base - which highlighted the point that Telstra is the largest carrier by subscriber base at this time. Considering that it is not appropriate to reference a forum thread, how can I best reference this to Wikipedia's satisfaction?

I also note that you removed the citations that pointed back to Telstra.com. The third party aspect of your requirement there is almost not appropriate when you are refering to direct history or a Telstra product reference on the topic. Specifically, the references to Telstra having the first automated mobile network are hard to find anywhere else but on Telstra's media pages - because quite frankly no other operator is going to want to talk about it, and no other Australian source of any repute exists on the internet that would be bothered backing up such claims that I have been able to find (again I dont like quoting news papers because there is no traceability as to the reliability of their sources in the first place - an encyclopedia based on newspapers is a sure way to enshrine into history some editors' warped viewpoint which may or may not be right, but someone reading something and seeing a reference pointing at a news paper may not recognise as simply being another editors point of view.

Please, can you outline how I can more effectively cite elements of my contribution and to an extent justify your requirements for citations where I have not yet been able to find any suitable meaningful references?
   

Hi. I'm not sure if you have checked out Wikipedia:Reliable sources which also links to many other wiki policies. If there is a few lines in the article which is in a source you can cite it more then once using [cite information here] once then adding  on the other sentences with in the article. 

Whirlpool isn't a reliable source but other if it links to a source you could use that source instead but as long as it's reliable source and a third party source.  

Websites Telstra and any company it owns isn't a third party source which can be seen a bias and can be seen as a point of view which it way we use third party sources (See Self-published sources).

Newspapers can be used whether or not it's a website or you can just reference the title of the article, name of the paper, page, date it was printed and who the story was written by, As you can trace Newspapers who's stories may not be online or the story was before the internet was around.

""""In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated their album ...""""

From the article:

In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated their album Warning from Stardust at No. 23 on its list of the """"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time"""".

Untrue.

This is the front cover of the September 2007 edition of Rolling Stone Japan (which would have come out in August or conceivably even July of 2007). It's the best reproduction I've found of the cover; Google image search may turn up a superior alternative. Unsurprisingly (as it's a Japanese-language magazine) it shows no article titled """"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time"""". It does however show an article whose title might reasonably be so translated. (Furthermore, Japanese magazines love decorative snippets of English; and it's conceivable that the actual article, which I haven't seen, is decorated with this or another English title.)

The web page that this article cites for the claim that In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated [etc etc] actually tells its readers that:

The """"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time"""" have been chosen by Rolling Stone Japan. Well, they've been chosen by RS contributing editor Kawasaki Daisuke, who also founded the very stylish pop music/fashion/design mag Beikoku Ongaku, so the list could very well be worthwhile.

(Rolling Stone Japan is linked to its web page; Beikoku Ongaku [literally """"America music"""", with a (jokily?) old-fashioned term for America] is linked to beikoku-ongaku.com, an anonymously run domain name running a website for some """"collagen drink"""" [?] put out by an unnamed company.)

So the source says that the records have been chosen by one person, Kawasaki Daisuke (or """"Daisuke Kawasaki"""", as en:WP would insist on writing his name).

Further, there's no hint on the cover of the magazine that the magazine is presenting the list as its list. Instead, it's just one article, and it's presented as the third attraction of the month, below a multipart feature on rock and ecology and also below something about Bob Dylan.

What kind of list is this? The small print on the magazine cover is too small for me to make out. But I showed it to Mrs Hoary (a native speaker of Japanese); and without any prompting from me she said that it almost certainly says 独断と偏見で選んだ. This means that it's a personal, opinionated choice.

There's nothing inherently wrong with personal, opinionated choices. I'd take the personal, opinionated choices of Pauline Kael over the collective wisdom of the various august bodies that showered awards over Forrest Gump. But I'd take them because she's Pauline Kael, not because the choices are opinionated. If Kawasaki is a noteworthy critic, then the listing  of course described as by Kawasaki, not as by Rolling Stone Japan  should be mentioned.

I know next to nothing about Japanese rock music criticism. But Daisuke Kawasaki doesn't have an article in en:WP. He's not mentioned in the ja:WP article on Rolling Stone. And I don't think he gets an article in ja:WP: certainly when I look for 川 or 河 in the list of articles in ja:WP that list to the ja:WP article on Rolling Stone, I see nothing.

Of course, plenty of noteworthy people never get articles at either en:WP or ja:WP. But without some indication of Kawasaki's noteworthiness, it seems odd for something like this  even if it were labeled as Kawasaki's opinion and not the opinion of Rolling Stone Japan  to appear in the lead of an article.

Right. So we've dealt with the question of Qworty's slander. Let's move on. Here's why you should not be involved in this discussion, Qworty. You have demonstrated - not simply to me; not simply to Wikipedia; but to THE WORLD AT LARGE - that you are incapable of editing in good faith. When the mainstream media characterizes you - Qworty - as a ranting, slanderous, biased editor, then... well, we should take that seriously.  I do hope you've read the Salon article about you? If not, let me quote: your screed was interpreted (rightly) as """"an apoplectic defense by one Wikipedia editor of actions that other Wikipedia editors labeled 'revenge editing.' There’s a lot of anger here (not to mention an unhealthy fixation with excrement!). Call me persnickety, but reading Qworty’s comments did not give me the greatest faith in Wikipedia’s internal process for building an encyclopedia of human knowledge.""""

Despite all of this, I've given her the benefit of the doubt. Now shall we get back to the tedious matter of editing this article?

Avoidant vandalism Removing {{afd}},  and other related tags in order to conceal deletion candidates or avert deletion of such articles. Note that this is often mistakenly done by new users who are unfamiliar with *fD procedures and such users should be given the benefit of the doubt and pointed to the proper page to discuss the issue.
Changing people's comments Editing signed comments by another user to substantially change their meaning (e.g. turning someone's vote around), except when removing a personal attack (which is somewhat controversial in and of itself).  Signifying that a comment is unsigned is an exception. e.g. (unsigned comment from user)

Talk page vandalism Deleting the comments of other users from article Talk pages, aside from removal of internal spam, or deleting entire sections of talk pages, is generally considered vandalism. Removing personal attacks is often considered legitimate, and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long Talk page to a separate file and then remove the text from the main Talk page.  The above does not apply to the user's own Talk page, where users generally are permitted to remove and archive comments at their discretion, except in cases of legitimate warnings, which they are generally prohibited from removing, especially where the intention of the removal is to mislead other editors.

Edit war
Hallo.
There is a big discussion (at least 4 years old) about Marco Polo birhplace. There are 2 claims:
a) Marco Polo is born in Venice
b) Marco Polo is born in a small island, in present day Croatia.
a) is reported by all (I wrote all) works on Marco Polo, includuing all (I wrote all) the scholars. Marco Polo clearry wrote to be """"Venetian"""". He refer to Venice as his hometownHi. His father and granfather were Venetians, etc. etc...
b) is a fringe thheory. In about 4 years, not a single valid scientific source, was presented (see talk page).

User Brutal wants to impose a POV. This POV is to present the theory B as trust-able, on the same level of A, but he does not present sources. In the article is written that """"the exact birthplace (of Marco) is unknown"""". That is no true: all the scholars says """"born in Venice"""". Where does this claim come from? I was just asking a source. That why I've inserted CN tags, which are refused as a """"POV"""" by my antagonist. With no discussion!
Now, I', going (sadly) to start an edit war. This is the story (check here)
1) I start a new discussion on talk page 
2) Then, I insert CN tags 
4) I am reverted by B. (POV edits) 
5) I inform you
6) I warn the editor in his own talk page, asking to discuss in talk page.
7) I restore my edit 
Now my antagonist was supposed to discuss in the article talk page, but he refuse. According to me he broke the rules So that:
8) Brutal revert me without discussion

What has been on the news this last month has been that sectors of the commuter network (the suburban train network) are being closed to convert them to the high speed network which will connect to guadalajara, im actually a bit confused and frustrated about this myself. And about the Priesmangoode design, what happened is Siemens original tender in the competition was the Velero, however it was given little interest due to lobbying by the Japanese with the E5 which at that point seemed like it would for sure become the winner. And Priestmangoode is only a designer so the need an actual manufacturing firm if they want their concept to come to life. They tried to interest other firms in Britain with the design but that didnt go anywhere. The Mexican transportaion secretary had already stated in the very beginging that a double decker system was preferable and since Siemens Velaro was pretty much already out of the compettition Siemens took back it's tender. Siemens then jointly (with priesmangoode) presented the concept to the Mexican transportation secretary that it could jointly manufacture the double decked Mercury design. But what really is the main aspect of why Siemens bid will probably win is because they are wiling to have the rolling stock fully manufactured in Mexico. This was in the July 2008 issue of Ferrocarril. In the end no real progress was really made in the final selection because then the Japanese and the French gave the same offer of manufacuring the trains in Mexico after Siemens came up with the concept so we still have to wait till 2011 to find out who wins / 69.235.193.67"

No, Dolphin52, you have not provided any such """"numerous authoritative sources"""" for the definition. I understand why you feel that my request for documentation """"doesn't make sense"""" to you. The request needs to be understood in the context of (A) Wikipedia policies and guidelines, and (B) rules of legal analysis. What you have done is provide numerous quotations  taken out of context  from various court cases and from other sources. Many of the court cases did not even involve federal taxes.

Further, assuming you are still defending the verbiage that was removed from the article, you appear to be arguing that an """"excise""""  in the U.S. constitutional law sense  is limited to a tax on privileges, etc. That argument is completely invalid.

There are two problems with the argument. First, none of the sources you provided say that all excises (in the constitutional sense) must always involve a tax on a """"privilege,"""" and none of the sources you provided stand for that proposition. Second, by contrast, I have specific federal court cases where the courts ruled various events or activities to be taxable events  yet those activities or events do not involve any """"privilege.""""

Later, I'll repost, on this talk page, the actual text that was removed from the article, and I will again summarize  applying Wikipedia policies and guidelines and rules of legal analysis  why the removed material was objectionable. The analysis you provided violates various Wikipedia rules, and it also violates some of the basic tenets of legal analysis.

Now, for some more background.

The argument that an excise (in the constitutional sense), must always involve a """"privilege"""" to be valid is called a """"tax protester argument."""" It is not only legally invalid, but it is worse: it is also legally frivolous. A person can be penalized monetarily for even raising such an argument on a federal tax return or in a federal court. Later, I'll also post examples of actual court cases where people specifically argued, using the """"privilege"""" argument, that their income could not be taxed under the federal income tax laws, and their arguments were ruled invalid.

On a separate note, it should be obvious that the argument that a excise (again, in the constitutional sense, not the statutory sense) must always involve a """"privilege""""  is legally nonsensical for an entirely separate reason: Engaging in criminal activity is not a """"privilege"""" in any correct legal sense. Yet, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the federal income tax (which is an excise) may validly tax the receipt of funds in a criminal activity (specific examples: funds received by extortion or embezzlement), even though the wrongdoer is required to return the funds to their rightful owner. And the federal courts have repeatedly and overwhelmingly ruled that the federal income tax is fundamentally an excise, not a direct tax. (I know of only a couple of cases off the top of my head where a federal court actually ruled a particular federal income tax to be a """"direct tax,"""" and one of those cases was later overruled). On this basis alone, an """"excise"""" cannot possibly be limited to ONLY a tax on a privilege, etc.

2aa6948a91fe7d41,"""== Perceptions of cuteness ==

I am ambivalent about the old meme reference in this section that the below poster complains about.  However, I do have a real criticism:

The line """"here are good evolutionary reasons to expect humans to find juvenile humans, and perhaps juvenile animals in general, cute."""" should definitly either expound on the alluded-to """"good reasons"""", or at the least link to somewhere in wikipedia where these reasons are enumerated and explained.

-B. McGrauw (not logged in)

I think the whole perceptions of cuteness section should be removed to improve the focus of the article. What things people find cute and possible reasons for that is an interesting question, but it is an anthropological question and serves only to muddle this article.

In any case, the """"Every time you masturbate..."""" joke should be removed. It was popular among internet humorists for a while, but not really worthy of note outside of its own article; also, it is an off color joke and goes completely against the tone of the rest of the article.

Any thoughts?
 
Hey.. i was looking for imformation on how to take care of abandoned kittens and came acrossed the discussion board.. i cant believe like a page was devoted to whether or not an article should linked on the page.. who really cares... i hope yas rnt losing sleep over it...(n)... i dunt mean to sound like a biotch... but its boring to read about all the complaints... and the point of the board is to write about cats/kittens.. atleast thats what the impression i got .. could b wrong though (anon)

The reference to the """"Every time you masturbate..."""" joke should be removed. It does nothing to enhance the article. And every time some kid looks up kitten on wikipedia, a parent has to answer questions about masturbation. It's offensive, if nothing else.  

In response to the first anon, this page is actually for discussion on how the article can be improved. Some off-topic comments are usually tolerated but long discussion threads are generally seen as disruptive.
In response to Wabazana, Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors. However, I do agree that this particular reference is a bit of a systemic bias towards nerdy references. I've boldly changed it to refer to Hello Kitty (which was already in 'see also'), which I think we can agree is going to be more familiar to the average reader.  

Lovely though it is, is """"perceptions of cuteness"""" really encyclopaedic?   
Well, it's interesting. It's written in a neutral point of view. And as regards verifiability, if 'kittens are cute' isn't common knowledge, then I don't know what is. So yes, I for one think it's encyclopaedic.  ( T | C | A ) 

I read about the '""""perceptions of cuteness"""" discussion on the wiki kitten page in the Wall Street Journal, Wed. August 15th edition, and was thrilled. The cuteness of kittens/cats is one of my favorite subjects, to the annoyance of everyone who knows me. I do agree with another poster's comment that the pics of the kittens on this page aren't necessarily the best. Feel free to use this picture of my kitten PJ.  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Pj_blinds.jpg
I believe when one sets his/her eyes on this image, there can be no question of the cuteness of kittens. Earnest t. bass is legendary and also a good example.  """

 Reason?

I thoroughly read your """"ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL"""" and what I don't get is why then have you not removed every link to every review on all of Wikipedia? They are all external links. They all """"tunnel people away from the wikipedia."""" So why then are you singling out a single website and removing all of the links to their reviews?  If you would have actually bothered to visit all the links (which I somehow doubt, as all your reverts were popups-assisted.. whatever that means) you would find actual album reviews that IMO are much better than some of the crap that Pitchfork spits out.

 High Tech Postcode Recommended

The code now recommended will be such that it can be supported on google maps, iphones and GPS and will be capable of a unique postcode for each property.

The report questions any plan to introduce a broad area code which is unable to identify properties and states that the proposal for a D04 123 type code may make address ambiguity and problems with finding properties in Ireland even worse.

The report is from the Joint Communications Committee of the Irish Parliament and includes members of most political parties. It was published on 31 March 2010 and will lead to a significant revision of existing proposals

Late on 1st April, the full report was released and is available for download here There is considerable mention of the use of GPS in relation to the new code in the report and both the HSE and the GeoComputation Centre in NUI Maynooth are quoted as being strongly in favour of a code which provides a unique identifier such as is achieved with a GPS related code..

There's only one reason why I've been inserting this into the Chicago Bulls article. I do mention that the Blackhawks and Bulls were in their respective league's finals in 1992. The only reason I mention the New York Rangers and the Knicks in 1994 is because Mike Keenan was coach of the Blackhawks in 1992 and was coach of the Rangers in 1994. During 1994, he was able to draw many parallels between the two dramas, having had experiences in seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective league's finals in the same year.  , (talk), 

There's only one reason why I mention Mike Keenan about the Bulls in 1992: In 1994, when he coached the Rangers to the Stanley Cup, the Knicks were in their finals. Then, he was able to draw from his many experiences seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective league's finals in the same year. Phil Jackson was right about the Rangers Stanley Cup being a great part of a great chapter in New York sports history. He knew that Keenan was experiencing what he experienced in Chicago two years before.  , (talk), 

The main source I'm citing is """"Spring of '94,"""" which aired in MSG Network, as well as my own thoughts for all of this. I followed both dramas in which both NBA and NHL teams from one city were in their respective league's finals in the same year. (Chicago in 1992, New York in 1994) During the drama in New York when the Knicks and the Rangers made it to their respective league's finals, Keenan drew from all his experiences seeing both NBA and NHL teams from one city in their respective league's finals in the same year that it was going to be a great chapter in a city's sports history. He knew from his experiences in Chicago that the Rangers' first Stanley Cup win in 54 years would be that. You have to keep in mind that he was coach of the Blackhawks in 1992 and the Rangers in 1994.  , (talk), 

The only reason why I mention the Blackhawks in the article on Phil Jackson and the 1992 Blackhawks in every article associated with the 1992 Bulls is because the coach of the Blackhawks in 1992, Mike Keenan, was able to draw from all his experiences from the Bulls/Blackhawks drama during the 1994 drama in New York when the Knicks and the Rangers were in their respective league's finals that year. Phil Jackson said the same thing.  , (talk), 

Houston Rockets

There's only one reason why I mention the New York Rangers 3-2 win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals in Houston Rockets articles. I want to make clear that their win in Game 7 of the NBA Finals denied New York from having both NBA and NHL titles in the same year, as the Rockets defeated the Knicks. 
I also try to make clear that both the Knicks and the Rockets got some inspiration from the Rangers win.  , (talk), 19:40, 2 March, 2009 (UTC)

 I Have been Trying to change my Tone  

Status comment seems to express '''the 1 and only the thing I was hoping for.
 
Thank you -

                     To Everyone Involved
 I understand that I myself have many faults and could have avoided it, if I was wiser and also headed the very wise sayings of JC -

such as  - A kind word Turns away wrath -  

But I am only human and I try to not be a hypocrite. 

I strive all ways to admit my transgressions and apologize for offence. And if asked even if I feel I am justified.

Others seamed to expect more from me - than they are willing to give themselves.
  
And really I thought mostly I was trying to teach or provide or gain explanation, not be self righteous.

But I can see others could easily perceive otherwise.
 
I Know I am ultimately To blame Because I am stubourn - I have difficulty with relating to some people and some forms of """"Authority"""" - and have spent much of my life bashing my head against brick walls. And It Hurts alot and iam sick of it.

And I am quick to anger when I feel disrespected unjustifiably.

I do not in any way attempt to justify all my statements etc as some were very malicious but I think only when I FELT forced into a corner.

            I Just wanted to clarify to you my Sincerity. 

                   Which is very very strong
 I am sorry - BUT This does not mean I that I would not again become angry? 

even to Plasmic Physics for obviously - He Knows Knot What He Does - Hopefully?
and- DMacks 
- But I also think they do have reason to be sorry also -
 
Iam sorry to DMacks for the final insults - but he did (I believe) on purpose ignore, again, his own words of advise and push that obvious button ON PURPOSE.  
          

But I still cant figure what Plasmic Physics and osperys wise council was.
  
And should see the truth in many of my sayings etc.

I also never intended any type of malicious revenge type behavior - 
Sincerely -
and any comments that may have been misunderstood Re DMacks etc? 
Were apart from the following up any confirmed malicious hacking of my computer systems.

Were in relation to Karma eg 

-Revenge is mine says the lord - etc

Even if I was to be let back in I don't think I am wanted or want to or the right type of personality.

I like looking for and correcting flaws in obvious logic/science of arguments, statements of things. mainly organic chem really and this seams to rub people up the wrong way  etc not chase up refs for every little detail

Any how I just wanted to leave you on that note.

What a waste of all our time.

Thank YOU Dirk, and I hope you appreciate Nick if nothing else."""

""""In December 2013, Waters was again accused of antisemitism after an online interview in which he compared the treatment of Palestinians by Israelis to the treatment of Jews by Nazi Germany.[123][124]""""

  

 FWIW, I believe this to be WP:NOTNEWS and WP:COATRACK type stuff that really does not belong in a bio on Waters at this point, but lest someone accuse me of ownership I'll step back and let others decide.  (talk|contribs)  
I dont object to adding about the latest anti semite allegations but only when our way of doing this fits WP:NPOV which the current insertion absolutely FAILS to do, we must be balanced and not take one side or another (in this case the side of those attacking Waters was taken as the only side of the controversy we reported)♫  talk contribs 

In the process you deleted 2 references/citations one of them was his interview. What kind of """"balance"""" are you looking for when people are not able to read Waters? Could you please bring back the references? Personally i just added the link to his interview. Beside that everything in the sentence was true. You could easily re-write the sentence and leave the citations there. No. You just deleted everything. AND the citations. Unacceptable.   
This is a BLP bio and so what I did was in no way unacceptable but if you want to re-frame what you wrote in an NPOV way why not do so here on this page first, you need to write in a balanced way as an editor and not rail against others cos you didnt do so♫  talk contribs

I was talking to   
 Its properly sourced now, so there is no need to pile up cites per WP:CITECLUTTER. Also, I'll remind you about WP:NOTAFORUM. This is absolutely WP:COATRACK/WP:NOTNEWS material, IMO. We aren't here to follow Waters' every comment regarding Israel. Is this notable enough for a bio? Not likely, maybe, but we are already in WP:UNDUE territory regarding this controversy, IMO.

John's edit is exactly what I mean by a neutral take on the issue. Nikosgreencookie, it is your responsibility as editor to get this NPOV right, and in all your edits, its not the responsibility of any editor who may revert you♫  talk contribs 

The best source and the best citation is his own words.

If you like to eliminate his political views and see him """"only"""" as artist you don't have idea what are you talking about.

 I hope you do not mind me asking but why is the name of the page the same as your username? You asked for help, well to wikify an article it means adding appropriate sections (which it has) and linking internally to other article which are relevant, for more info see Wikipedia:Wikify. For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word Villain by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce Villain. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain. Hope this helps.[[user talk:tellyaddict|addict]][[Wikipedia:Editor review/Tellyaddict|Editor review!]] 
Ashnard is my favourite Fire Emblem character, so I thought it would be fitting to create/edit a page involving him as my first article, thanks for the advice, I will always try to improve the standard of articles. THANKS!!  talk 
 Hey 

Very strange.

You know what? Ashnard reminds me of Colonel Volgin. (You've played MGS:3 I assume.)
That's not good, by the way... do you like him too? Just picking on you, but still... it's a weird character to like soooo much. If it makes you feel better, I didn't like Ike too much, but don't you dare talk crap about Greil. Err. See you around, Ol' King Daein. Peregrine 

 Yes, I have played MGS3, I love that game, I am also quite partial to Greil (although I prefer to call him Gawain). Ashnard is quite like Volgin, but Ashnard isn't a bisexual pervert. So...Thanks for the comment, I'm really starting to get use to this place.  talk 

This is true!!! You have a good point on me, there. Haha, well... You make SURE you have fun here on wikipedia. And, on a side note: Ivan is hardly a man. Happy editing.  Peregrine 

I will, by the way, have you noticed that Rolf from Path of Radiance seems incredibly ...effeminite? That boy must be the campest thing in videogames (besides Tingle). I mean, he seeks support from Mist.  talk 

Oh, Rolf... give him a chance. Atleast he's not an idiot like Boyd, or walking around with his eyes closed all the time like Oscar! He's still a kid, he could, uh... ya know, toughen up as he ages. (Maybe we'll see in GoD, who knows? Sothe definetely came a long way... if he just ditched that belly shirt) Plus, he's a sniper...so snipers rock, right? Tingle frightens me to my core, ahhh. I am not fond of that fairy-loving, body suit wearing freak with little man boobies. Have you played Twilight Princess? Looking back I don't think Tingle was in it at all. Thank goodness. Well, see-ya. Peregrine 23:13, 19 F"

As I stated previously, my speciality is Egypt, not Rome, but the same issue arises with Egyptian sources of the same era.  Basically, scholars from this period have great difficulty in perceiving, accommodating, or finding language with which to describe beliefs which are not found in Christianity.  Rather, scholars of the period -consciously or not - tend to describe by analogy with Christianity.  An absolute classic example is the translation of maa kherau as 'victorious''triumphant' or 'vindicated'. The words mean 'a true voice' and literally means that what one says will come about - but the underlying concept bears no relation whatsoever to the Christian concept of being saved from sin, having overcome Satan through faith in Christ. The Kemitic Egyptians had nothing that equates to the Christian belief in the need for salvation. The reason for the choice of words appears to be connected to Matthew 17, where Jesus drives out a demon that his disciples had been unable to exorcise, and tells them that with even a little faith they could command mountains to move about. A man who had passed the test of the judgement hall obtained power in Amentet, such that what he commanded to happen would happen, therefore according to the Christian model, this must be because he had in some way achieved the status of a Christian saint."

Be sure to read my love note to David, which those jealous queens and others removed over and over: David, honey, thank you so much for your sweet love note. How nice! But you have it wrong, honey: I'm not interested in APK or Lucas, it's only you that I want, only you! Nobody can even hold a candle to you, my love. I only have eyes for you. Think of me when we're not together, and do remember this: We'll always have the East Village.  
When we're apart, my consolation is in knowing that because of you I am assured in my sexuality...you, the love of my life, and the object of my most exquisite sexual fantasies. 
I look forward to being with you again, whether it's in our love nest in EV or at our mutual friend's house on Fire Island. You remember that place, don't you my sweet: that blue and white striped sofa!, the dbl-glass doors opening onto the balcony and the chopped wood piled there (was there any wood left after our last visit?), the knotty wood planks on the walls and ceiling, oh and that ridiculous ceiling fan!  it was like being fanned from above by six eunuchs!

Technically, there are two articles, but the one from 2006 relies only on the one from 1944 as its sole source, and does not indicate that the author of the 2006 did any independent research beyond finding the 1944 article on the Internet.  Generally, Wikipedia does not consider a single unverified first-person account to be sufficient, and that should be especially true when it is anonymous.

2. According to the 1944 article, there should be many, many witnesses.  After 69 years, neither the Pope, nor any of the Vatican officials there with him, nor any of the 80 or so visitors waiting has confirmed that this incident ever happened.  Some of the witnesses, especially the German soldiers, might have died before the story was first published.  However, if it was true, there should have been at least some surviving witnesses.  The lack of any independent verification makes the entire story rather doubtful.

 Origin of the theory of Liszt's """"piano revolution"""" 

The theory of Liszt's revolutionising piano playing was apparently an invention of Lina Ramann. She had in November 1876 asked Liszt whether his """"Umwälzung der Klaviertechnik"""" (""""Revolution of piano technique"""") had been due to Paganini's Caprices. on December 1 Liszt wrote to this that it was his biographer who had to decide, since he himself was unable to take an objective point of view towards his foolish own productions. It was his only consolation that they could have become even worse after all.

Lina Ramann's """"decision"""" can be found in her Franz Liszt als Künstler und Mensch, Erster Band, Zweites Buch, p.106. According to this, Liszt's hands had been rather small and could hardly stretch a 9th. From Paganini's Caprices, according to Ramann, Liszt took the idea how to play wider intervals, and this was his entire """"revolution"""". Ramann's theory is of course wrong. There were others who wrote wide intervals as well (for example Schumann, Chopin, Henselt, Thalberg, Döhler, Dreyschock and many further ones). To this comes that the theme of Liszt's Clochette-Fantasy was not taken from Paganini's Caprices, but from a violin concerto, and that there are no extraordinarily wide intervals in this particular piece. It is to be presumed that Liszt himself read Ramann's theory with astonishment.85.22.19.160  """

 the author of the article simply presents an overview of the development of the Moshiach identification campaign within Chabad and further states elsewhere on his site that he doesn't believe the Rebbe is Moshiach therefore it obviously doesn't belong in the Chabad Messianic sites section.

However after the amendments I made, following Dori Smith not accepting my page for copyright reasons, I cant see that there are any copyright issues. The structure of the page matches all comparable organisations in the field. The content is laid out in a different manner to the organisation's website and with different wording. Some of it is the same, but this is as some of the wording in the sector is fixed (and used across all relevant wikipedia pages), such as private sector development in conflict affected environments or sustainable poverty reduction/economic development.

 Melanie Phillips 

Hi, thanks for your message. I reverted three attacks on her, I think I muddled yours with another one (prob. The New Statesman one) hence my edit comment when reverting yours was inappropriate, and I apologise for this. Regarding your the refs, the first one says:

""""Lovers of the unusual, rejoice! Within days Melanie Phillips will make a public apology. In July 2008, Mad Mel lifted and embellished a mistake from the neocon website, Harry's Place, regarding Mohammad Sawalha, a Palestinian-born British man whom Al Jazeera had mis-transcribed referring to """"evil/ noxious"""" Jews at a rally"""" 

This is a cheap and nasty throwaway remark, it contains nothing of substance, and in fact is a pure ad hominem attack. So I'm not sure that under BLP guidelines it's appropriate at all. 

The second one says:

""""Indeed, within much of the liberal commentariat, she has long been dismissed as """"Mad Mel"""", as someone who has lost her rational and moral compass"""".

Here, the writer is reporting unnamed third-party sources. This hardly seems a good source for what in effect amounts to a grievous BLP violation. 

I have two other comments about the page:

 wouldn't it be much better to try and find sources which engage critically and rationally with her views, instead of regurgitating the above types of nastiness?
 there have been some quite vile instances of vandalism on the page recently and in addition there seems to be a general tendency/trend at the moment to denigrate her in some way, almost as though it's the only way of editing the article. As editors we should I suggest be careful not to be influenced by this, and to steer well clear of ad hominem-type slurs and focus on her views instead. Best wishes,   """

 Articles for creation/Northwest Car Owners Club (NWCOC) 
Thank you for writing the following message to me:  
Thank you for your message regarding my recent submission for Northwest Car Owners Club (NWCOC). You declined it on the fact that there were not enough references in the article. There is a reference to the main website which backs up what the article is about. What other references would you suggest? There has been no books on the subject, as of yet no media coverage, although that will be coming in the next show season. I am now at a loss as to what other reference apart from the website can be used.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Please review the  guidelines for notability of websites help page.  You will note that your article, unfortunately, could have been declined for more than one reason - I chose to refer to the lack of independent references which also means the subject is not """"notable"""" as that term is defined by Wikipedia.  I have no doubt the webcite is helpful to its users but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a web directory.  At the help page you will read that if, as you have indicated, there has been no significant media or other independent coverage related to the cite then the cite is not """"notable"""" as defined by Wikipedia and cannot be the subject of a Wikipedia article.  

The guideline reads (in part): 

In the dictionary, notable means """"worthy of being noted"""" or """"attracting notice."""" Wikipedia bases its decision about whether web content is notable enough to justify a separate article on the verifiable evidence that the web content has attracted the notice of reliable sources unrelated to the web content, its authors, or its owners. Notability requires only that these necessary sources exist, not that the sources have already been named in the article.

""""Notable"""" is not synonymous with """"fame"""" or """"importance,"""" and even web content that editors personally believe are """"important"""" or """"famous"""" are only accepted as notable if they can be shown to have attracted notice. No web content is exempt from this requirement, no matter what kind of content it is. If the individual web content has received no or very little notice from independent sources, then it is not notable simply because other web content of its type are commonly notable or merely because it exists (see """"If it's not notable"""", below).

I hope, after reviewing this guide, you will understand why I was unable to accept your article. However, if you feel I was wrong and your article meets the criteria for notability of a website, you may wish to access the Dispute Resolution Notice Board to discuss the issue or seek a  Third Party Opinion from another experienced reviewer who may well take a different view.

Karljoos, you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country? How in the hell is that possible? Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries. Are you ok?

Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. 

Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south america’s distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know.

Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans don’t view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. 

Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also.

 Are you quoting somebody there, or is this your own list. I'll try to address the points raised:

 1) """"Hearsay"""" is rumour received from others that one did not personally hear oneself. That does not describe Table Talk, which is essentially a primary, contemporary source of edited notes taken down by scribes. Mein Kampf I believe was also began as a text dictated by Hitler, rather than written by Hitler - is that hearsay too? And what of notes taken by Speer - is that """"hearsay""""? (Interesting you note that Bormann was anti-Catholic. Why then would a """"devout Catholic"""" as you term Hitler, appoint an """"anti-Catholic"""" as his Private Secretary and the defacto Deputy Fuehrer?)

2) Multiple translations - a valid issue to raise, but given that Hitler and his henchman all, strangely enough, conversed in German, we are dependent on translations in all cases - whether it be Mein Kampf, Inside the Third Reich, or Table Talk. The fact that authors like Kershaw, Bullock, Encyclopedia Brittanica and Toland all quote from Table Talk is evidence of its essential bone fides - though if you are aware of alternative translations provided by reliable sources, please do present them (or bracket them as """"also translated as"""").

3) The """"bias"""" of the translators. Can you provide reliable sources for this please.

4) I do not know what you mean by """"the Table Talk thoughts do not occur in other private or public conversations"""". Table Talk contains all sorts of quotes which are reinforced by other sources! To pluck one from the countless options: Speer (whom you view as a reliable source) says that Hitler made """"harsh pronouncements against the churches to his political associates in Berlin"""" and specifically notes that Bormann relished to take down Hitler's harshest comments on the Churches. Goebbels diary (per Kershaw & others) is another source, confirming Hitler's thinking on the Church Struggle. 

5) You say """"Nowhere does Hitler denounce Jesus or his own brand of Christianity"""". This comment seems to suggest that you are indeed willing to accept the validity of at least some of the Table Talk text. Good. So please note: the text says Hitler believed """"it is certain that Jesus was not a Jew"""" and that the Apostle Paul """"falsified"""" Jesus' doctrine. These alone are the words of a heretic, not a """"devout Catholic"""". Agreed? As a sign of good faith, it would help at this point if you renounced the claim that Hitler was a """"devout Catholic"""". Beyond this, the transcripts are thoroughly peppered with denunciations of Christianity.

 6) The anti-Christian pronouncements contained in Table Talk are entirely consistent with the Nazi efforts to promote positive Christianity as a substitute for Christianity. The renunciation of the Bible and Jewish origins of Jesus (which """"positive Christianity"""" entailed) was to give him a """"false birth certificate"""" as Cardinal Michael Faulhaber put it in 1933, and the notion of the myth of blood and soil was, as Pope Pius XI wrote in Mit brennender Sorge in 1937, entirely inconsistent with Catholicism and Christianity more broadly: """"The peak of the revelation as reached in the Gospel of Christ is final and permanent. It knows no retouches by human hand; it admits no substitutes or arbitrary alternatives such as certain leaders pretend to draw from the so-called myth of race and blood"""". Hitler, plainly was not in """"good standing with the Church of Rome"""" in 1937!   """

This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

 Some  Wikipedia  """"Contributors"""" giving the Dictator Jose Eduardo dos Santos an Engineer Degree in Petroleum 

This section is taken out from the propaganda web page of the MPLA Peoples Party (Communist Party).
Looking at the dates there is no chance that Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos could have gone to Russia for a Oil Engineer Degree. Also the MPLA official web page does not mentions any such degree as well. Taking into consideration that this would be considered a major achievement it seems odd to say the least that the MPLA Comrades Totalitarian Party have """"forgotten"""" to mention this intellectual and academic achievement of their murderous and deep ignorant leader.

But in wikipedia from (night to day) """"voila"""" Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos (a son of a Sao Tome brick layer) could not have gone to Russia or Timbuktu for a degree, as it was economical impossible to him to afford such studies. 

People in Angola who are still alive knew personally this communist and murderous pig, as having only two shirts and only a couple of suits, how could this criminal afford to go to Russia for his Engineer degree, and if he had been there and made his degree (3 to 4 years minimum) then there is no time in the description of his activities and exiled years in Congo Brazzaville.

From the MPLA Web Site: """"Após a eclosão da luta contra a ocupação colonial, em 4 de Fevereiro de 1961, José Eduardo dos Santos, então com 19 anos, abandonou em Novembro desse mesmo ano o país e passou a coordenar no exterior a actividade da Juventude do MPLA(organismo de que é um dos fundadores). Integrou em 1962 o EPLA (Exército Popular de Libertação de Angola), participando na preparação das condições para a abertura da 2ª Região Político-Militar. Em 1963 foi o primeiro representante do MPLA em Brazzaville/ Congo. Nesse mesmo país, depois de terminados os seus estudos superiores, frequentou durante um ano um curso Militar de Telecomunicações, que o habilitou a exercer, de 1970 a 1974, sucessivamente as funções de Operador do Centro Principal de Comunicações da Frente Norte e Responsável-adjunto dos Serviços de Telecomunicações na 2ª Região Político-Militar do MPLA (Cabinda). Em 1974, José Eduardo dos Santos é designado membro da Comissão Provisória de Reajustamento da Frente Norte, responsável das Finanças da 2ª Região, e desempenha novamente as funções de Representante do MPLA em Brazzaville, até Junho de 1975.""""

So lets hope that common sense sinks in, and that we can see what is obvious, and lets not allow the good nature on which the Wikipedia project was founded and based to be a place where totalitarian communist regimes use this space and wikipedia inadvertently is perceived as a tool to validate their Regimes, we therefore as freemen and humans, we must not allow this space to be used with the aim to prize this (or other) criminal murderous Communist Dictator.

 The article still needs some work to fully comply with the Manual of Style. Per Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context#Dates stand alone years should not be linked. There are several instances of linked years in this article. 
 Also per Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context words should only be linked if they provide appropriate context for the article. An example of this problem happens in the Economy section where common words such as aircraft, coffee and automobiles are linked. 
 Per WP:DASH date ranges should not use hyphens but rather endashes. This seems to be a problem in citations.

 Adding material, citations, general cleanup and resolving dispute 
I have painstakingly documented Warren Farrell's biography and professional discourse, supporting my edits with citations. In the Myth of Male Power, he endorses the concept of a ‘gender transition movement‘ as an alternative to either a ‘women's movement‘ or ‘men's movement‘. He has maintained this position since the book's publication in 1993, and has continued to promote the notion in every book published since. Additionally, I cannot find a single original, citable source to support use of the term masculinist being applied to him. As such, I have removed references to this non-neutral term.

I hope anyone watching this page will agree that I have enhanced the quality of this article tremendously. I am going to remove the request for cleanup and the neutrality dispute since I don't see any recent, active discussions that will remain unaddressed with the addition of the careful citations I have added.

(previous content:)
Warren Farrell (born 1943) is an American masculist author.

Farrell holds an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Political Science (UCLA; New York University (NYU)). He has taught at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, and at Georgetown University, Rutgers, Brooklyn College, and American University.

With the publication of The Myth of Male Power, Farrell became one of the first masculists. The term is difficult to precisely define, but in his case masculism is a form of celebrating men as no less than women, and rejecting any sexism displayed against men by women. Since the early 1970s, he has been a champion of feminism, serving on the board of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Within a few years, he was asked to leave NOW as his views diverged from those generally held in the organization; most specifically, he was critical of what he saw as female exclusiveness and disregard for men's issues. His early books The Liberated Man and Why Men Are the Way They Are were more in the vein of a type of men's liberation–an approach to men's issues similar to that of feminism to women's issues. These texts were not critical of feminism.

Farrell's critics declare him to be sexist and have an anti-woman attitude (or misogynistic). However, despite his being broadly attacked by many latter-day feminists including Susan Faludi.  In answering his critics, Farrell argues that his approach is essentially of equality and humanism. 

His approach to gender issues has come to be the cornerstone of masculism. His ideology calls for gender equivalence and, unlike some other masculists, a reduction in traditional gender roles. He has made a critical examination of the power imbalance between the sexes, claiming that in some cases it favors women: """"The women's movement had done a wonderful job of freeing women from sex roles, but no one did the same for men"""". 

Farrell was a candidate for governor in the 2003 California recall election. He came ninety-seventh out of 135 candidates. 

On May 27, 2005 Farrell appeared on John Stossel's """"Give Me A Break"""" segment of 20/20 to discuss, in his view, why men earn more. In the report he is seen speaking before the Cato Institute. He asked members of the audience to stand if they worked at least two years at a job meeting certain criteria: jobs which exposed them to wind and rain or long hours, for example. It was almost entirely men who stood.

Some suggest that the Cato Institute event had been staged to promote Farrell's books and opinions. Nonetheless, the event served to illustrate one of Farrell's key points - that women tend to choose, and are generally encouraged by the popular press to choose, jobs that are socially fulfilling rather than monetarily fulfilling. For instance, men are encouraged to work well-paid, long-hours jobs, whereas women are encouraged to search for jobs that allow them more time with their children or are seen as socially pleasant, involving little physical labour or serious physical unpleasantness. These jobs, across the board, tend to be paid less than the former. In addition, men are more likely to do overtime (and are of course encouraged to do so) than women, so necessarily get paid for more hours worked.

Dear Dabomb87,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

BBC did indeed release it's list of """"Top 100"""" based on 30,000 respondents. 

BBC's numerical """"rankings"""" of the 100 apparently weren't disclosed until, after the """"poll"""" was rather heavily flogged in a series of broadcasts, in which each of the """"Top 10"""" were advocated by various celebrities/authorities/commentators, and during which time a vastly larger number of """"voters"""" called in. 

I seem to remember the final number on order of 130,000. Whether or how this affected final rankings, is apparently unknown. Obviously these people were if nothing else, in some degree, TV fans.

The Wikipedia article seems to fully accept the validity of the BBC """"poll"""" (which was not at all focused on Scott). Further, the article implies (to me) that the poll revealed a decline, over time, in Scott's popularity with the British Public. 

Seems like a reasonable thesis, but without comparable """"polling"""" data from previous periods, this is not more than interesting speculation on the part of whatever author is cited.

For deep background, Wikipedia itself has a number of (non-featured) articles that are somewhat relevant with regard to the rather complex topic of polling, including sampling error margin of error,  tracking poll, straw poll, and various other topics. 
I'm certainly uninformed.

The path- There are two types of path (UK) footpaths for walkers and bridleways for walkers, horses and other riders- to a walker the change from footpath to bp is an important consideration- to a horseman it is the difference between allowed and not allowed. I suspect mountain bikers have a similar opinion- do we need to show both- how does this internationalise. I was thinking dark green/ light green but couldn't decide which way round- though if the distinction is not important it should default to dark as this looks clearer. (I'm thinking of printouts too.)
For gradient there seems to be several ways to proceed. As I have said, I was thinking of chevrons like the lock symbol.A double for 1:3 and a single for 1:5 (but this could be adapted meaning very steep and steep- which would vary in context). The German Bahn site has a section for Mountain lines where a spot height is given in a column to the right of the track. This seems simple, effective and could be used on footpaths.

 Ongoing IAU discussion? 

Is the reason that there was no improved IAU definition of planets that they wanted to pass such a decision with a large majority, but couldn't come to an agreement yet? I hope it's not that they think the current definitions are OK, because they're clearly not. For example the definition of extrasolar planet states the lower mass limit for an object to be an extrasolar planet is the same as in the Solar System... but there was no such limit given. Neither for dwarf planets nor for regular planets. There would have been no harm done if the upper limit for extrasolar planets was also applied to the Solar System, but that wasn't done either. It's like they're hiding everything behind smoke and mirrors and make up the results as they go.

It would be relatively easy to come up with criteria that could decide if a newly discovered body is a planet or not. But they didn't do it. Why? What for example is wrong with the following?
1. A planetary mass object is an object with a mass between the agreed mass limit needed for hydrostatic equilibrium (5×1020kg) and the agreed mass limit needed for deuterium fusion (2.5×1028kg). (Both limits might be set lower since the first would exclude Pallas and Vesta which are remaining protoplanets and the second doesn't take into account that objects with high metallicity could allow deuterium fusion at a lower mass)
2. A planet is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that also has the capability of clearing its orbit (per Stern-Levison criteria. The difference is you only need to know mass and orbital period of the object (and the star of course), whereas with Soter's criteria you'd need to know everything about the system).
3. A dwarf planet (I prefer mesoplanet) is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that doesn't fulfill the Stern-Levison criteria.

More definitions could be added to account for other types of planetary mass objects. I prefer """"planetar"""" for those that don't orbit any star - regardless if they were formed by themselves or in a system of which they were later ejected. Also, I'd like """"moon"""" to mean a planetary mass object that orbits a planet (since the prototype object Luna is just that) - smaller bodies would just keep being """"satellites"""". (If you don't like to have 60 planets of which most are small, why would you allow 60 moons of which most are tiny?)

Any ideas why the IAU doesn't come up with something like that?   

First of all, there is a lower mass limit: hydrostatic equilibrium. Second, this has nothing to do with improving the article. Simply talking about the merits or lack thereof of the IAU's decision is outside the scope of Wikipedia. podous 
Your second point is right. My opinions are not relevant, as I'm not an astronomer, and my conclusions from the available data would be OR, so neither belongs in the article. But you don't seem to realize that your first point is extremely open to definition. It could mean the shape of the object. Then the next question is where the limit between spheroidal and irregular is. It could mean an object with this mass and composition would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. Or it could mean an object with this mass would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. I'm heavily in favour of the third, as it is the one that could be most easily checked (especially for exoplanets), and avoids the problem that an ice world could qualify, while a larger and denser asteroid would be rejected, since rocky worlds are much harder to pull into equilibrium. But from statements in the article, I'm guessing at least those astronomers favor the second one. (And if they're not representative, why would they be in the article?)Basically, I want to say that the IAU should make a decision that makes it clear the astronomers know what they are doing and want to share their knowledge with the public. Because if the public decides to not follow astronomers' findings anymore, the result will likely be even less funding... and that would be a real problem.    
There are many ambiguities with the current definition, all of which are mentioned in the article already. podous 13:29, 19 Januar"

Arbitrary break for my reply
but if we really can't say that with our own experience from watching the show then we should remove the rest of """"such and such is based off of the character such and such from the original version"""" (at least for every character but the main three, maybe)

You're totally right with this, and I hadn't noticed that this was noted for other characters.  For now we should pull it. But I think eventually we'll see reviews and interviews noting the comparisons we've made.   But unfortunately, per the  original research policy we can't make those statements based on our own observations.  It's really frustrating sometime when something is so obvious but it prevents more problems than it causes.  Keeping the main three shouldn't be an issue; the show runners have talked about the one-to-one comparison to their UK counterparts in interviews.  It's something I've been meaning to go looking for (the articles where they've talked about how they are similar and different from the originals) but haven't had a chance to do yet.  This sort of thing is always an issue on list of character articles -  they tend to get updated with plot summary and very little else.  But as the show progresses there will be more material to drop in so that the article isn't so in-universe and has more real world info.

But would you still remove my edits if I added that information to the casting section?

If we can find the links to back up the comparisons, absolutely not.  I think it will be great info to provide once we have our sources.  It's exactly the kind of thhing I mean by real world info (casting the roles, how they are changed from originals by creators, how actors interpret the scenes and characters).  

Actually what I gave in my first reply wasn't plot summaries, but character summaries. 

That was actually a reference to an edit that came after yours.  Someone added waaay too much plot detail in there and I was reverting past two people's edits.  Since the lines for our edit summaries are so short, I find it hard to be clear about that sometimes.  

And while unsourced original research, it was from my experience of watching every season and  episode of the UK show so far and doing the same pretty much with the American one. I hate things like this where it's true but you have a hard time finding something that confirms it's true due to Wikipedia's standards. 

I know exactly what you mean.  It drives me bonkers sometimes.  I like to drove myself nuts last year looking for this little bit I remembered from an interview about an actor on True Blood.  But it really does prevent more problems than it causes.  Imagine if every person who had an off the wall interpretation of a scene came in and said """"well this bit reminded me of this thing in another thing so clearly the other thing was an inspiration.""""  

No need to make this personal. But if I really did come across that way I'm sorry, because I didn't mean to.

Not personal at all; no worries.  I just figured you undid before you saw  my reply to you here.  My edit summary probably seemed more blunt than I meant it because, again, trying to explain the reversion of more than one edit.  And I do waaay too much recent changes patrolling which seems to lead to a severe truncating of verbage in edit summaries.  I probably seem like a stark raving butthead half the time when I'm just trying to be brief.  I think you have great instincts about the type of stuff we'll want to include on the article.  We just have to find the articles to back up the info.  There's not going to be a lot out there yet because it's the first season but it'll be awesome if we can start getting the article overhauled with this kind of stuff right away.  I follow the UK version's article and a few other list of character articles that have been going on for years with just updates to plot summary and no real world stuff.  So now it's particularly overwhelming a thought to try and fix them.  The True Blood characters page is my personal nightmare.  I'll get around to it?

One thing I've been looking for is an article I read just before the premiere that talked about changes made to the three main characters.  I vaguely recall that it had some quotes from the writers and a couple of the actors (I think Witwer mentioned something about watching the UK version).  I can't seem to dig up the link from the message boards where I read about the show though.  Ack."""

 Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND and still more """"Critique of the Universe"""" 

This goes to the whole question of the exclusive use of a single model of the universe that depends on the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. The consensus interpretation of the Lambda/cold dark matter model must clearly be flawed if it leads to the conclusion that the scientific method must be scrapped in order to save the model (ref). Dark Matter and Dark Energy are ad hoc """"add-ons"""" that are trying to find theoretical justification. Dark Enegy, in particular, is being called a supernatural or """"unfalsifiable"""" hypothesis because no experiment can possibly directly challenge it (ref), just like the existence of God hypothesis.

Heretofore, all hypotheses must adhere to the scientific method (ref), """"the SM"""". Now, in order to admit Dark Energy, cosmologists insist that SM must be tinkered with and an unfalsifiable hypothesis allowed for the first time in history. If we do this, the Pope can re-ascend to the Throne.

All of the indirect """"overwhelming evidence"""" for expansion rate acceleration and Dark Energy can be just as well applied to the concept that our inventory of matter and energy in our local universe is inadequate and that the mass of the global universe is at least 22.2 times as large as has been supposed (100%/4.5% = 22.2). The total mass of the universe has been and still is open to question. The Matter/Energy that we can inventory accounts for only 4.5% of the total needed to """"flatten"""" the anisotropy pattern that is seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or """"CMB"""" (ref). This proposed revision in the """"total mass"""" and the General Relativity (GR) concept of the black hole hyperbolic field will save not only SM, but the Friedmann Equations and the FLRW metric themselves too! 

The """"inflaton particle"""" from which the universe may have sprung was the mother of all black-holes (MOAB). As such, it must have possessed an hyperbolic gravitational field that existed timelessly according to Alan Guth's quantum principles (ref). During the instant of inception of the differentiated universe that we can now detect, this hyperbolic field must have begun to degenerate. Space with time came into existence during this instant. The implication here of the prior existence of a sort of meta-universe is not explicitly acknowledged in any of the scenarios we read, but it is nonetheless an unstated assumption. 

This space-time bubble's surface traveled up the MOAB's hyperbolic field gradient at a velocity hundreds or thousands of times the speed of light. This is Allan Guth's """"Inflation"""". Matter/Light could keep pace with the inflation of space-time only as long as its temperature was several exponential decades of degrees Kelvin. As soon as Matter/Light began to condense and the fundamental forces began to differentiate, the inflation era ended (ref). The collapse of the infinite density hyperbolic field began. This hyperbolic field has been collapsing by means of a time-dependent process ever since. It is this ongoing transition from a hyperbolic black hole gravitational field to a parabolic Newtonian gravitational field underlying the global universe that is being mistaken for acceleration and Dark Energy (ref).

This is not speculation. This is not my personal idea. This is but one example of a different logical meaning of Allan Guth's inflation theory (ref)and General Relativity according to Schwartzchild (ref) and many others. When guided by correct meta-logic, mathematical physicists will be able to validate this or some other theoretical interpretation of GR, the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. Then, with the demise of Dark Energy and Dark Matter, the scientific method will be saved (ref).

 Found 

I found this piece of text on another wikipedia article: 'aryan race'
Genetic studies

A genetic study in the year 2000 in Andhra Pradesh state of India found that the upper caste Hindus were closer relatives to Eastern-Europeans than to Hindus from lower castes.[25] However, a study conducted by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in 2009 (in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT) analyzed half a million genetic markers across the genomes of 132 individuals from 25 ethnic groups from 13 states in India across multiple caste groups.[26] The study asserts, based on the impossibility of identifying any genetic indicators across caste lines, that castes in South Asia grew out of traditional tribal organizations during the formation of Indian society, and was not the product of any Aryan invasion and """"subjugation"""" of Dravidian people.[27]

hello and thank you for your comment.  I can see how you might have gotten the 'rag bag' impression, but what I've done is to simply make links from greatness to articles on individuals who were specifically mentioned on that page in relation to a specific aspect of social scientific research re the topic of 'greatness'.  Einstein and da Vinci, for example, appear twice in the 'greatness' article.   I have only made 8 such links and have another four or five to do.  that is all.  if I were reading the Einstein article, for eg, and came across a link to an article which discusses major social scientific research done on the topic of 'greatness' in which Einstein was considered, I would follow it up with interest.

 Potsdam Declaration 

Here some quotation from the """"Official Gazette of the control council for Germany"""" (Documents relating to the establishment of the Allied Control Authority) - published by the """"Allied Secretariat"""" in Berlin, Elssholzstrase 32.

Under item VI (Statement by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic and the Provisional Government of the French Republic on the zones of occupation in Germany) they write:

""""1. Germany, within her frontiers as they were on 31st December, 1937, will, for purposes of occupation, be divided into four zones, one to be alloted to each Power as follows ...""""

Under item  VIII (Report on the Tripartite Conference of Berlin) and there Article IX concerning the western frontier of Poland they write:

""""The three Heads of Government reaffirm their opinion that the final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement.""""

Until this peace conference the disputed territories """"shall be under the administration of the Polish State and for such purposes should not be considered as part of the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany.""""

So keeping in mind this facts sincerely it´s obvious that the (West-) Allies didn´t order any transfer of Germans out of their ancestral homelands because by doing this they would have created a fait accompli. 

Actually Russia and Poland created such accomplished facts by expelling most of that Germans - even quite long before the Potsdam Declaration. 

(Comment: Any forced transfer of population is a crime against humanity; and this it was already at times of 1945 - Nazi-Germany was trialed exactly for such crimes, too.)

 Not sure what you are getting at here or the point your at attempting to make. (???) Hand loaders/ reloaders do not look at SAAMI/CIP when they create their own ammunition.

Factory manufactured ammunition should only be listed for illustrative purposes and for good reason, they respect a standard which is safe in a vast majority of caliber specific firearms. Conversely, if no standard is maintained for a given cartridge then data from reloading manuals should suffice. I am well aware that .325 WSM components are available in Europe, a cursory check on component sellers websites evidence this. BGO...

I was made aware by an outside source of the page recently, and merely selected the review history option to see what had been done and by whom. I did in fact make all my comments via the TALK section, and never received and answer as to why Doc James was so consistent in his posting misinformation and taking information out of context.  Your organization calls that vandalism according to your own documentation.  His response to me was to attack and impune my character. My response was to question his ethics, which are still in question and remain unanswered. If this is not an ethical issue than it is one of competence and that raises quality control issues within the Wiki community and why when questioned the response is to exclude rather than explain.  This is all about education isn't it? I only entered into this site to make sure that the truth was preserved. What is wrong or misplaced with questioning errors? What is misplaced is the ability of the person who is questioned, in your words """"even if he was completely wrong in his edits"""", to not come clean and fix the issue and admit the wrongdoing or mistake vs. attacking someone who actually was trying to make sure the information in Wiki was correct.

Though these acounts vary, in general they portray Jesus as a 1st-century Jewish sage or prophet who had a following but who did not establish a religion or send his disciples to convert the gentiles. Scholars of the historical Jesus use the historical method and Israeli archeology to reconstruct a biography of Jesus. They debate whether he preached the imminent end of the world, his connection to religious groups (such as the Essenes), and which sayings attributed to him are actually his. The so-called quest for the historical Jesus began with Hermann Samuel Reimarus and continues today with scholars such as the fellows of the Jesus Seminar.""""

 Midway = turning point 

In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being """"merely"""" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. 

Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.

I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: 

1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)
2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.
3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.
4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. 
5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.

But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.

So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.

The scholarly back-up of doctrines is a separate issue, and really has no bearing on whether Witnesses believe something or not.

The point is, the article is to present what Witnesses as a group believe, and what criticisms exist, and the extent of this criticism.  There is a threshold as to what divergence is notable and worth mentioning, and how extensive coverage of it should be, and your views simply do not represent the percentage you seem to think or hope for.

 VfD on Jews by country 

This has not yet been submitted, and John would wig out if I submitted it myself. But I suggest you discuss this with others ASAP. I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures, that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends. That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.

As an example, being Australian I checked his figure for """"Australian Jews"""" in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population. I am afraid this is seems to be another example of where this author has misrepresented certain details to create the illusion that he is scholarly NPOV author. 17:32, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)"""

What do the three edits Feb. 24 have to do with the sock puppetry investigation of COI from 2006 and early 2007?  This all seems like a big stretch to formulate a grand conspiracy theory where there isn't any. Editors were aware of the COI back when it happened (years ago) and dealt with it.  The article is edited and watched closely now. 

Are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article? Hardly a high crime it seems to me.  What you're really upset about is that someone did an unfavorable (but accurate) story about how all attempts to include any mention of controversies or criticisms in the Obama article were reverted. News flash, many of us have had the exact same experience this editor had. If we block users for editing under """"false pretenses"""" so be it, but lots of editors post on other sites about their experiences here. This hardly seems like some grand scheme to bring Wikipedia to its knees.  

This check user investigation, however, and the AfD certainly look like an overeaction that only adds fuel to the fire. Klein said he asked someone to make the edits to see what would happen. He reported on the experience and those he witnessed of other attempts to edit the page that are easily viewed through the history.  This hardly seems like something worth making a federal case over. The only mischaracterization is yours: """"under false pretenses to incite a block and, through off-wiki agitation, bring disrepute on the project and trigger a major meltdown on the Obama page."""" The fact is the editor in question arranged for an attempt to make a reasonable edit to grotesquely biased article and reported on the experience.  That it's not favorable to Wikipedia is certainly cause for reflection and consideration of how we can improve our handling of issues like this in the future.  I know when something messed up is noted on another site and people here are made aware of it there's usually an effort to fix it.  That happened in this case, but the guardians of the Obama page made sure nothing changed.  So be it. If it upsets and embarasses you as it does me, do something to fix it.   """
